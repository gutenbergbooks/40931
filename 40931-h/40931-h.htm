<h2><i>Preface</i></h2>


<p>The history of the final union of England and
Scotland, which took place on the 1st of May 1707,
commences with the accession of Queen Anne;
and with regard to that event, the best sources of
information, apart from original letters, diaries,
and other contemporary documents, are Daniel
Defoe’s <i>History of the Union</i>, published in 1709,
Dr. Hill Burton’s <i>History of Scotland</i>, Mr. John
Bruce’s <i>Report on the Events and Circumstances
which produced the Union</i>, published, for the
use of Government, in 1799, and Dr. James
Mackinnon’s <i>Union of England and Scotland</i>,
published in 1896. In this volume I have
endeavoured to describe the <i>earlier</i> attempts to
unite the kingdoms. These commence, practically,
in the reign of Edward <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> of England,
and continue, taking sometimes one form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and sometimes another, down to the reign of
William <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></p>

<p>While giving an account of the various negotiations
for union, and of the union which was
actually accomplished during the Commonwealth,
I have tried to depict the state of feeling between
the two countries on various points, and particularly
in regard to the Church question, which
bulks more largely than any other in the international
history of England and Scotland.</p>

<p>It is a story, sometimes of mutual confidence
and common aspirations, as at the Reformation
and the Revolution, but more frequently of
jealousies, recriminations, and misunderstandings,
most of which are now happily removed.</p>

<p>My authorities are sufficiently indicated in the
footnotes.</p>

<h2><i>The Early History<br />
of the<br />
Scottish Union Question</i></h2>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL POLITICS BEFORE THE UNION
OF THE CROWNS</h3>


<p>The races which inhabited the northern parts of
England and the southern parts of Scotland were
descended from a common stock, and spoke a
common language. But for centuries the problem
of uniting them baffled the best-laid plans of kings
and statesmen; and neither force, nor policy, nor
treaties of marriage between the royal families,
seemed capable of destroying the inveterate rancour
which the peoples felt towards each other. The
petition in response to which the papal sanction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was given to the intended marriage of Prince
Edward to the Maid of Norway, pointed out the
wisdom of removing, or at least mitigating, the
enmity of the two nations; and it was the avowed
policy of Edward the First to combine the marriage
of his son to the young Queen of Scotland with
a peaceful union of the kingdoms. The clergy,
the nobles, and the people of Scotland agreed to
the proposed alliance, and were willing that their
queen should be educated at the English Court.
The marriage-contract was prepared; and the
prospects of a lasting peace were bright, when the
death of the young princess on her journey from
Norway suddenly changed the whole course of
events.</p>

<p>The competition for the Scottish Crown; the
arbitration of Edward; his claim to the title of
Lord Superior; the invasion of Scotland; the
occupation of Scottish strongholds, and of large
portions of Scottish territory, by English garrisons;
the homage paid to the English king by the
competitors for the Crown; the spectacle of Englishmen
filling many great offices of State;&mdash;all tended
to exasperate the Scottish nation. But Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
never seems to have doubted that he would succeed
no matter at what a cost of blood and treasure
in joining the kingdoms. Indeed, it appears that
from the summer of 1291, when the competitors
for the Crown granted him possession of Scotland
until his decision should be made known, he
regarded the two countries as practically one.
Scotland is described, in public documents, as
“notre ditte terre d’Escose”; and it was expressly
declared that, as England and Scotland were now
united, the king’s writ should run in both realms
alike.<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>

<p>During the inglorious reign of Baliol, and
throughout the period of anarchy and turmoil
which followed its termination, Edward never lost
sight of his favourite policy of an union, which,
though brought about by conquest, and imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by force of arms upon the people of Scotland,
would, nevertheless, in course of time, secure for
him and his successors the sovereignty of an undivided
kingdom from the English Channel to the
Pentland Firth. In pursuance of his policy he
resolved to hold a Parliament in which Scotland
should be represented, and by which regulations
should be framed for the future government of
that country. To this Parliament, which met at
Westminster in September 1305, ten representatives
of Scotland were summoned.<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> All of them
attended except Patrick Earl of March; but his
place was filled, at the king’s command, by Sir
John Monteith, the betrayer of Wallace, whose
execution had taken place less than a month before.</p>

<p>With the Scotsmen twenty-two English members
were conjoined; and to the Council thus formed
there was administered one of the elaborate oaths
which were then supposed to be peculiarly solemn
and binding. They were sworn on our Lord’s
Body, the Holy Relics, and the Holy Evangels, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
give good and lawful advice for maintaining the
peace of the king’s dominions, especially in Scotland,
and loyally to reveal any hindrances they knew to
good government in Scotland, and how these might
be overcome.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that the commissioners
from Scotland were free agents in this Parliament.
But it suited the purposes of Edward that the
ordinance which was now to be framed for the
future government of Scotland should be promulgated
as the result of deliberations in which the
people of Scotland had a voice. It was for this
reason that the Scotsmen had been summoned to
Westminster; but the ordinance left all real power
in the hands of Edward. Sir John de Bretaigne,
the king’s nephew, became Warden of Scotland,
with a Chancellor and Controller under him.<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a>
Eight justiciars were appointed. Six of them were
to administer law in the lowlands; and the
dangerous duty of executing justice “beyond the
mountains” was entrusted to Sir Reynaud le Chien
and Sir John de Vaux of Northumberland. Sheriffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
were appointed, most of whom were Scotsmen;
but the castles were left in the hands of English
commanders. The laws of King David of Scotland
were to be read at public meetings in various places,
and such of these laws as appeared unjust were to
be amended.<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a></p>

<p>About this time Edward writes to the Sheriff
of York, giving orders that nobles, prelates, and
other people of Scotland journeying to and from
England, were, in future, to be courteously treated,
and that anyone who used threats or bad language
to them, or who refused to sell them food, was
to be punished. Similar orders regarding the
treatment of Scotsmen in England were sent to
the Sheriffs of London, and many of the English
counties. Edward perhaps thought that by this
semblance of an union, founded on conquest and
set forth on parchment, his long-cherished schemes
were at last accomplished. But his plans had
hardly been completed, when he found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
confronted by that combination of the Scottish
people which, during the reign of his son,
triumphed under the leadership of Robert Bruce,
and finally secured the complete independence
of Scotland on the field of Bannockburn.</p>

<p>The marriage of the Princess Margaret,
daughter of Henry the Seventh, to James the
Fourth of Scotland, stanched for a time&mdash;but
only for a time&mdash;the torrent of blood which was
shed in the wars which raged, one after another,
for nearly two hundred years after the death of
Bruce. Another period of warfare followed, during
which the disasters of Flodden Field and Solway
Moss left Scotland apparently at the mercy of
England. But when Henry the Eighth attempted
to reconcile and unite the nations by a treaty of
marriage between the Prince of Wales and Mary,
the youthful Queen of Scots, the Scottish Estates,
while agreeing to his proposal, declared that, after
the marriage, Scotland was to remain a separate
and independent kingdom; and it was soon found
that to propitiate the Scottish nation was a task
beyond even the long experience and the profound
diplomatic ability of Sadler. Sadler argued that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
England had a young prince, and Scotland had a
young princess, and that if they were betrothed,
“these two realms being knit and conjoined in one,
the subjects of the same, which have always been
infested with the wars, might live together in
wealth and perpetual peace.” “I pray you,” said
a Scottish statesman in reply, “give me leave to
ask you a question: If your lad were a lass, and
our lass were a lad, would you then be so earnest
in this matter? Could you be content that our
lad should marry your lass, and so be King of
England?” And when Sadler answered that he
would, the Scotsman shook his head. “I cannot
believe,” he said, “that your nation could agree to
have a Scot to be King of England. And likewise
I assure you that our nation, being a stout
nation, will never agree to have an Englishman
to be King of Scotland. And though the whole
nobility of the realm would consent to it, yet our
common people, and the stones in the street, would
rise and rebel against it.”</p>

<p>Then, to enforce the treaty of marriage, came
the invasion of Scotland, when Edinburgh was
burned to the ground, when the port of Leith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the picturesque castles of Roslyn and Craigmillar
were in flames, when the abbeys of Melrose and
Dryburgh were laid in ruins, and when the villages
and farms of the lowlands were devastated by the
English soldiery. But the violence of Henry was
in vain; and during his reign the Scottish people
hated England as they had never hated her before.<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a></p>

<p>The project of uniting the kingdoms by a royal
marriage was not abandoned on the death of
Henry; and in the first year of Edward the Sixth,
the battle of Pinkie, the last great battle between
England and Scotland, was fought. But the
Protector Somerset soon found that the Scots,
though defeated, were as determined as ever to
resist the English connection, and that the Scottish
Parliament had at last resolved that their young
queen should be betrothed to the Dauphin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sent forthwith to France, to be educated at the
French Court. This resolution, so fateful to Mary
Stuart, then a child of only six, altered the views
and policy of Somerset. In the name of the
English Council he issued a remarkable proclamation,
in which he proposed that the Crowns should
be united, and that the kingdoms should become
one. “We invite you,” it was said, “to amity and
equality, because, as we inhabit in the same island,
there is no people so like one another in manners,
customs, and language.” There was to be freedom
and equality of trade between England and
Scotland. The subjects of both kingdoms were
to be allowed to intermarry. If the Scots wished
it, the name of England would be abolished, and
“the indifferent old name of Britains” taken again.
“If we two,” the proclamation declared, “being
made one by amity, be most able to defend us
against all nations; and, having the sea for the
wall, mutual love for garrison, and God for defence,
should make so noble and well-agreeing a monarchy,
that neither in peace we may be ashamed, nor in
war afraid of any worldly or foreign power; why
should not you be as desirous of the same, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
have as much cause to rejoice at it as we?”<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> But
these overtures were too late; the Queen of Scots
was sent to France: and when, two years later,
peace was proclaimed, Scotland remained unconquered
and independent.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace declared that the boundaries
of the two countries were to be the same as they
had been before the outbreak of war between
Henry the Eighth and James the Fifth of Scotland.
An attempt was made to deal with that portion of
waste land upon the western borders which had
been, for so long, a harbour of refuge for the outlaws
of both kingdoms, and which was known as
the Debateable Ground.<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> It was to be divided by
march stones; and ditches and enclosures were to
be made for the purpose of hindering the flight
of marauders. The English were to relinquish all
lands and houses which they had seized; and those
fishings on the river Tweed which the Scots had
possessed before the war were to be given back to
them.<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Never in the history of this island, except afterwards
during the reign of Anne, was the Scottish
question so troublesome to England as during the
second half of the sixteenth century. The immense
additions which, of late years, have been made to
our sources of information have not changed, to
any great extent, the aspect of the long familiar
picture, nor caused us to relinquish the old opinions
regarding the characters and motives of those who
held in their hands the tangled threads of international
policy during the fifty years which preceded
the Union of the Crowns. To use the Scots for the
purpose of weakening England had long been the
policy of France; and when war between Spain
and France broke out in 1555, and an English
army was to be sent to the assistance of Spain, the
French Court hoped that an army from Scotland
would march across the Tweed. Mary of Guise
assembled the Scottish nobles, and proposed that
they should seize the opportunity of taking
vengeance for all the wrongs which their country
had suffered since the fatal day of Flodden. But
the proposals of the Queen Regent were not
received with favour. She had been so foolish as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to confer several important offices of State on
Frenchmen; and these appointments had given
great offence. During the late war the Scots had
resented the manner in which their allies had
behaved on several occasions, and had seen them
depart with feelings of intense relief.<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> Moreover,
the spread of the Protestant opinions in Scotland
had naturally led many of the people to suspect
the motives of a Catholic power. The Queen
Regent, indeed, succeeded in bringing England and
Scotland to the verge of another contest; but, in
the long-run, the Scots refused to encounter the
risks of war for the purpose of assisting the
ambition of France.</p>

<p>The marriage of Mary and the Dauphin involved
the renewal of friendly intercourse with France;
but the terms on which the Scottish Parliament
agreed to this alliance provided for the complete
independence of Scotland.<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> The crown matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of Scotland was conferred upon the
Dauphin; but the oath of fidelity which
the Scottish ambassadors took to the heir
of France, as King of Scotland, was framed
so as to exclude any allegiance beyond
that which the subjects of Scotland had
hitherto acknowledged as due to their native
princes.<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p>

<p>It had never been possible for England, under
any circumstances, to be indifferent to the affairs
of Scotland; and the relations of the two kingdoms
were now more complicated than ever. But it
was not until after the death of Mary of England
that the results of the French marriage became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fully visible. “War with France; the French
king bestriding the realm, having one foot in
Calais and the other in Scotland; steadfast
enemies, but no steadfast friends.”<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> Thus stood
England at the close of the year 1558. The
Dauphin and Mary proclaimed themselves King
and Queen of England as well as Scotland; and
the arms of England were quartered with the
arms of France and Scotland on their plate and
household furniture. This was an open assertion
of the illegitimacy of Elizabeth and a challenge
to England. But, in the meantime, peace was
preserved. The Treaty of Cambray, which terminated
the struggle between France and Spain, and
to which England and Scotland were parties,
left the claims of Elizabeth and Mary untouched;
and, on the ground that “the plenipotentiaries for
Scotland have not sufficient knowledge of the
state of affairs depending between the Crowns of
England and Scotland,” it was decided that
English and Scottish commissioners should afterwards
meet and decide on “certain articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
respecting the peace and concord of the two
kingdoms.”<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a></p>

<p>These commissioners met; and the result was
the treaty of Upsetlington.<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> A fresh attempt was
made to frame rules for curbing the lawless spirit
of the Borderers; and it was also agreed that the
limits of the two kingdoms should be the same as
they had been before the accession of Elizabeth,
that the town of Berwick should not be molested
by the Scots, that the English garrisons should
not trouble their neighbours on the other side of
the boundary line, and that great caution should
be observed in granting passports to the subjects
of either kingdom.<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Protestant opinions had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
steadily gaining ground in Scotland. The Congregation,
as the reformers were called, and their
leaders, known as the Lords of the Congregation,
had hitherto been on good terms with Mary of
Guise. Without their assistance the Dauphin
would not have obtained the title of King of
Scotland; and she had, therefore, not interfered
with the progress of the new beliefs. But soon
after the Treaty of Cambray, Monsieur de Bettancourt
arrived in Edinburgh, charged with a
message from Henry of France. The New
Learning was to be suppressed on the continent
of Europe and in England; and the Queen
Regent was expected to join France, Spain, and
the Holy Father at Rome, in the league which
they had formed for that purpose. Scotland was
the stepping-stone to England. If the ascendency
of France and the Catholic Faith was once secured
in that country, the heretic Elizabeth would be
driven from the throne which she had usurped.
Therefore the Regent must no longer remain
inactive. Against her will, so far as we can judge,
Mary of Guise entered on the disastrous contest.
A proclamation was issued, commanding all men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to go to mass, to use the confessional, and to conform,
in all respects, to the Church of Rome.
The Lords of the Congregation remonstrated;
but the Regent refused to give way.<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> At this
crisis Knox returned to Scotland from Geneva.
A week after his arrival he preached at Perth;
and after his sermon the religious houses of the
Black and Grey Friars, and the Carthusian
Monastery, were laid in ruins. From Perth the
excitement spread over all the country. The
Protestants flew to arms in numbers. The Regent
mustered her forces, and it was evident that a
desperate struggle was at hand.</p>

<p>At first the Lords of the Congregation carried
everything before them. But they knew that,
before long, the Regent would have an army of
well-trained French soldiers under her command;
and it was vain to suppose that religious fervour
could prevail against military discipline. Help
must be found in some quarter; and a correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was opened with the Court of England.
James, third Earl of Arran, was, after his father,
the Duke of Chatelherault, heir-presumptive to
the throne of Scotland.<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> A marriage between
him and Elizabeth might, it was suggested, settle
the Scottish question. A majority of the Scots
were Protestant; and in the turmoil of the civil
war which had now begun, Mary of Scotland
might, with the help of England, be dethroned by
her own subjects, against whom she had allowed
a foreign army to be sent. If Arran and Elizabeth
were married, the Crowns of England and
Scotland would then be united; and thus the
schemes of France would be frustrated. There
can be little doubt that all this was understood
between the Congregation and their friends in
England, though it was not openly expressed.
Cecil encouraged the idea, probably with the
assent of Elizabeth; and the Lords of the Congregation
implored her to come to the rescue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and carry out that union of the realms for
which so many wise men had long laboured in
vain.<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a></p>

<p>The death of Henry the Second did not change the
policy of France. Scotland was to be subdued;
and then Elizabeth could be dealt with. The
councils of England were divided; but Cecil was
in favour of sending help to Scotland. “The best
worldly felicity,” he said, “that Scotland can have
is either to continue in a perpetual peace with
the kingdom of England, or to be made one
monarchy with England, as they both make but
one isle divided from the rest of the world.” But
this was impossible if the French were allowed to
govern Scotland; for they would use Scotland
for their own purposes, and “make a footstool
thereof to look over England as they may.” As
no heir had been born to the Queen of Scots, and
as she was absent from her kingdom, the nobles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and commons of Scotland ought, under the guidance
of the Hamiltons, who were the next heirs
to the Crown, to free the land of idolatry by such
a Reformation as had already taken place in
England; and, “before the French grew too
strong and insolent,” a number of abuses which
threatened to ruin the country should be remedied.
If the Queen did not agree to these reforms,
then she must be held to have forfeited the
Crown.<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a></p>

<p>As to the question, which was really the
practical one, of whether England should join
Scotland in resisting the French, the voice of
Cecil gave no uncertain sound. Every country
had, he said, like every man, the right and duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of self-defence, not only against present danger,
but also against danger which might be foreseen.
No greater danger could be foreseen than the
occupation of Scotland by France, the implacable
enemy of England. Therefore “England both
may and ought to aid Scotland to keep out the
French.”<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Such was the advice of Cecil, set forth in a
paper written apparently on the 5th of August.
Three days later Sadler was on his way to
Berwick, armed with full powers to negotiate
secretly “for the union of the realms,” and
furnished with a sum of money for the use of the
Congregation. Arran, who had escaped from
France and come to England, followed him. A
long time was wasted in correspondence between
Berwick and London; and at <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'least'">last</ins> Chatelherault
and the Lords of the Congregation, weary of the
long delay, marched to Edinburgh at the head of
their followers. The Queen Regent took shelter
behind the walls of Leith. An instrument suspending
her from the Regency was proclaimed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the town-cross of Edinburgh; and a letter was
sent to her demanding that she and the French
troops should retire from Leith. But, instead of
doing so, she attacked the forces of the Congregation.
They were compelled to leave Edinburgh;
and it thus became evident that, as the Regent
could already cope with the Congregation, Scotland
would be at the mercy of the French army, which
might arrive at any moment.</p>

<p>At this point, when the fate of Scotland was
trembling in the balance, Maitland of Lethington
was sent to London to make a final appeal to
the English Council. A paper has been preserved
which expresses, with all the acuteness of that
adroit politician, the views of Maitland on the
relations of England and Scotland. The old
cause of enmity, he says, between England and
Scotland, and of the friendship between France
and Scotland, was the claim of feudal superiority
which the princes of England had set up. To
resist that claim, and to save their country from
conquest, the Scots formed alliances with France.
From the first, many in Scotland doubted the
wisdom of these alliances; and now the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
all were opened. They saw the inordinate
ambition of France, and wished to form a league
with England.<a name="Anchor-21" id="Anchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> The fear of conquest made the
Scots hate England and love France. Now the
case is changed; “Shall we not hate them and
favour you?” If we have been so faithful to
France, from whom we have received so little, can
you not trust us to be faithful to you, who of all
nations are most able to bestow benefits upon us?</p>

<p>But it may be said that as soon as the present
quarrel is ended, we shall once more make friends
with France. Peace is, indeed, the end of war;
but England may rest assured that we in Scotland
know our own interests too well to make such a
mistake. Where could we look for help against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
France, at any future time, if we played false with
you?<a name="Anchor-22" id="Anchor-22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> Besides, it is the interest of England to
unite with us. France is not making all these
warlike preparations merely for an expedition
to Scotland. All Europe knows that an invasion
of England is intended. Have you forgotten
Calais? You are blind if you do not see that
they are acting as cunningly as they acted then.
Beware lest you find yourselves saying, when it
is all too late, “If we had only known.”<a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> Do not
let this opportunity escape you. If you once
allow the French to become masters of Scotland,
is there a man whose judgment is so much at
fault as not to show him that France, having once
conceived the image of so great a conquest as that
of England, will endeavour to accomplish it?</p>

<p>Nor must you believe those who call us rebels.
We maintain the queen’s right. We study to
preserve the liberty of her realm at the hazard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
our lives. If, during the absence and minority of
our sovereign, we tamely allow strangers to plant
themselves in our strongholds, to seize the reins
of government, and alter our laws at their pleasure,
may she not hereafter call us to account, and may
not the people esteem the nobles of Scotland
unworthy of the place of councillors? All we
desire is to defend the freedom of our country and
the independence of the Crown.<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a></p>

<p>Finally, do not lightly reject the friendship of
Scotland. England is separated from every other
nation by the sea; and if she unites with Scotland,
her defences will be complete. Study the advice
which Demosthenes gave to the Athenians, and
you will learn what a wise man should do when
his neighbour’s house is on fire.<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a></p>

<p>It was to press these views upon the statesmen
of England that Maitland had been sent to
London; and he was empowered to make an offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which shows that the Lords of the Congregation
were in deadly earnest. Let everything, they
said, which is past and gone be forgotten&mdash;Edward
the First and Wallace, Bruce and Bannockburn,
Flodden and Pinkie, all the long roll of victories
and defeats on one side or another; let the words
England and Scotland be obliterated; and let the
two nations become one under the name of Great
Britain, with Elizabeth as ruler of the United
Kingdoms. It is impossible to say what would
have followed if the English Council had entertained
this proposal. But it implied war with
France, not only on the Scottish border, but at
every vulnerable point upon the coast of England.
Even on the question of sending troops to
Scotland, Elizabeth hesitated for a long time. But
at last Cecil persuaded her to make up her mind.
A fleet, under the command of Winter, sailed for
the Firth of Forth; and an army of eight thousand
men, under the command of Lord Grey, Warden of
the Eastern Marches, was mustered at Berwick.</p>

<p>Then, after all these months of irresolution, the
effect of a firm policy was seen. The French
ambassador at London apologised for the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of Mary and the Dauphin in assuming the arms of
England, and threw the blame upon the late king;
and an offer was made to restore Calais if England
would refrain from interfering in Scotland. But
to this offer Elizabeth is said to have returned the
haughty answer that “she did not value that fisher
town so much as to hazard for it the state of
Britain.”<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a></p>

<p>And now, for the first time, English soldiers
were to enter Scotland as friends. But before the
decisive movement was made, Norfolk, Lieutenant
of the North of England, went to Berwick and made
a convention with the Lords of the Congregation.
Scotland was put under the protection of Elizabeth
during the subsistence of the marriage of the
Queen of Scots and the King of France. For the
preservation of the liberties of Scotland, and to
expel the French, an English army was to cross
the border.<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> England became bound never to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
permit Scotland to be conquered, or united to
France, otherwise than it already was by
the marriage of Mary and Francis. Scotland
became bound to send an army of four thousand
men to assist England, if, at any time, she was
invaded by France. Argyll, as Lord Justice of
Scotland, was, if required by the Queen of England,
to act with the Lord Lieutenant in reducing the
north of Ireland to obedience. England was to
receive hostages for the due performance of these
stipulations on the part of Scotland.<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Treaty of Berwick was signed on the 27th
of February; but so unwilling was Elizabeth to
take the final step that nearly a month had passed
away before the troops were allowed to advance.
At the end of the month the greater portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
army crossed the Tweed.<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> They were well received
by the country people; and on the 4th of April
the English and Scottish leaders held a council of
war at Pinkie House. In the operations of the
next three months everything centred round the
siege of Leith. In spite of the gallantry of the
French, the garrison was reduced to desperate
straits. The French fleet, with reinforcements on
board, was scattered by a storm. The Queen
Regent died during the night of the 10th of June
1560; and four days later the preliminary articles
of a treaty were signed at Berwick.<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a></p>

<p>Peace was finally concluded at Edinburgh on
the 6th of July. Mary and the Dauphin were
to give up using the arms or the royal title of
England. The fortifications of Leith were to be
demolished. All the French soldiers, except one
hundred and twenty men, were to leave Scotland
at once. The affairs of Scotland were to be
administered entirely by Scotsmen; and the
executive government was, during the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Mary, to consist of twelve persons, of whom the
queen was to choose seven from a list of names
drawn up by the Estates. On the question of
religion, it was agreed that when the Scottish
Parliament next met, a deputation should be sent
to France to lay the wishes of the country before
the queen.<a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a></p>

<p>These events not only proved that England
was strong enough to set the arms of France at
defiance, and to reject the councils of Spain, but
they established, for all time to come, a close and
real connection between England and Scotland.
In the hour of danger the best men in Scotland
had turned to England for help. Cecil, and those
who thought with him, had persuaded Elizabeth to
disregard all interference and the remonstrances of
foreign Courts. She had done so with reluctance.
Slowly and through many a tortuous path she had
sent help to Scotland; but, in the end, the
deliverance was complete. The war and the
treaty of July 1560 destroyed the French influence
in the northern portion of the island, taught the
Scots that it was only by an Union with Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
England instead of Catholic France that their
liberties could be maintained, and opened the way
for the Scottish Reformation. For the Lords of
the Congregation were now supreme; and before
the end of August, without waiting for the queen’s
consent, the Estates had met and passed the statute
by which they disowned the authority of the Pope.<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a></p>

<p>But although so much had been done, the
marriage of Elizabeth and Arran was as far off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
as ever. In their policy of binding the nations
together by a closer tie, Cecil in England and
Maitland in Scotland had a great mass of public
opinion to support them, especially on the
Protestant side.<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> The Scottish Estates were so
eager for the Union of the Crowns that they
would not listen to Maitland, who, though strongly
in favour of the marriage, foresaw difficulties which
could be only overcome by waiting; and it was
resolved that commissioners should at once be sent
to lay the wishes of the Estates before Elizabeth.<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a></p>

<p>If Mary of Scotland died without issue, Arran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was, after his father, the next heir to the Crown;
but it can scarcely be doubted that the Lords of
the Congregation did not contemplate waiting for
the extinction of the Stuart line. Mary had not
been in Scotland since her childhood. She was
Queen of France; and, in all probability, she
would remain in France for the rest of her life.
So long as Mary of Guise was Regent, so long as
Frenchmen governed Scotland, so long as Scotland,
like France, adhered to the Catholic Faith,
the power of the house of Stuart was hardly, if at
all, impaired by the absence of the queen. But
now all this was at an end. Mary of Guise was
dead. An English army had expelled the soldiers
of France. The government of Scotland was in
the hands of Scotsmen. The Scottish nation was
no longer Catholic. To celebrate the mass was
an offence against the law; and the Scottish
clergy were using the Prayer-book of Edward the
Sixth. Thus it was a mere form of words to call
Mary Stuart Queen of Scotland as well as of
France. Of real power she no longer possessed a
vestige; and it is easy to see that in the first
bloom of the Scottish Reformation, with Knox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in full vigour, and with the whole country in
revolt against the Romish priesthood, the marriage
of Arran would very likely have been followed by
the triumph of the Protestant Hamiltons over the
Catholic Stuarts, and the union of the two
nations, with one crown, and probably with one
form of Church government.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the history of great events we too
seldom remember that kings and queens are, after
all, merely men and women. Here was a crisis at
which the Protestants of England and Scotland
were unanimous in wishing the Defender of their
Faith to enter upon a contract, by means of which
she would accomplish what had been one of the
great ends of English policy from the days of
Edward the First to those of Henry the Eighth.
But that contract was one which concerned her as
a woman rather than as a queen; and she knew
that the ceremony which might put the Crown of
Scotland within reach of the Queen of England
would, while uniting the kingdoms, separate
Elizabeth Tudor from Robert Dudley. The Protestants
of England knew this, and dread of the
Dudley marriage, as well as their anxiety to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cement the alliance with Scotland, made them
support the pretensions of Arran.</p>

<p>But suddenly, before Elizabeth had made up
her mind, the death of Francis the Second saved
her from the necessity of giving a definite answer
to the Scottish commissioners. This event, by
which the Crowns of France and Scotland were
once more separated, opened a new scene in the
drama of international politics, and enabled her
to escape from the dilemma in which she found
herself. She thanked the Scottish Estates for
the goodwill which they had displayed towards
her; and she assured them that she regarded the
offer of marriage as a token of their wish “to knit
both theis kingdomes presently in Amytye, and
hereafter to remaine in a perpetual Amytye.” But
in the meantime, though she had a high opinion
of the Lord Arran, she was not disposed to take
a husband, and she thought that the friendship
of the nations could be maintained without a
marriage. With this unsatisfactory answer the
commissioners were obliged to be content.<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>Then came the return of Mary to Scotland, her
stubborn refusal to ratify that clause of the Treaty
of Edinburgh by which she was to give up using
the title of Queen of England, her quarrels with
the reformers, and the long series of misfortunes
and misdeeds which ended only with the tragedy
of Fotheringay.</p>

<p>The failure of the marriage negotiations was
taken as an insult by the Scots; and doubtless
this accounts, to some extent, for the cordial way
in which Mary, in spite of her adherence to the
Church of Rome, was welcomed on her return
from France. The project of uniting the kingdoms
by a royal marriage was not again renewed in so
definite a form; but during the numerous intrigues
spread over so many years, the purpose of which
was to find a husband for the Queen of Scots, the
effect which her marriage would have upon the
relations of England and Scotland was never lost
sight of. If the suitor for her hand was a Protestant,
he was favoured by those who desired to
see peace between the two nations; if he was a
Catholic, by those who desired a renewal of the
French alliance, or at least a rupture with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
England.<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> Protestant or Catholic? that was the
great question for England and Scotland then, as
for the rest of Europe. Everything turned upon
that. During Mary’s short sojourn at Holyrood,
and during the long years of her captivity in
England, everything&mdash;conspiracies against Elizabeth;
the rise and fall of Regents in Scotland;
the civil wars with all their treachery and bloodshed;
the assassinations; the beheadings&mdash;every
episode and every scheme, however disguised, was
a part of the contest between the old faith and
the new.</p>

<p>During these years of trouble the Protestants of
the two countries drew gradually together; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the year 1586 the kingdoms entered into a
compact which lasted until the death of Elizabeth
and the accession of James to the throne of
England.</p>

<p>The Duke of Guise asked James of Scotland to
join the Holy League. But to this invitation he
returned no answer; and Sir Edward Wotton, who
was sent as ambassador to the Court of Holyrood,
found that James was ready to form an alliance
with Elizabeth and Henry of Navarre in defence
of the Protestant religion. A Scottish Parliament,
which met at St. Andrews in July 1585, authorised
the king and his Council to enter upon a league,
more strict and firm than any previous league,
between England and Scotland, which, the Estates
said, were naturally allies, and were alike exposed
to the assaults of the common enemy.<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> In the
following year commissioners for both kingdoms
met, and signed the League. It was agreed that
the sovereigns of England and Scotland should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
defend the Protestant religion against all comers.
There was to be an alliance, offensive and defensive,
between the countries. If England was invaded
at a point at a distance from Scotland, an army of
seven thousand Scotsmen was to march to assist
her. If Scotland was invaded at any place distant
from England, twelve thousand Englishmen were
to help her. If the invasion took place near the
Borders, James was to send as many troops as he
could muster to the spot. If any trouble arose in
Ireland, none of the inhabitants of Scotland were
to be permitted to go thither. Neither kingdom
was to shelter rebels fleeing across the Border. All
former treaties of friendship between the countries
were to remain in force; and James bound himself
to see, when he reached the age of twenty-five,
that these terms were ratified by the Scottish
Parliament.<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a></p>

<p>Nothing was said about Mary of Scotland during
these negotiations. She was entirely ignored; and
it is impossible to say how far this may have helped
to remove any scruples which she might have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
about the objects of the Babington Conspiracy.<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> Her
execution, however, endangered the new alliance
when it had existed for only nine months. The
Scottish clergy had, indeed, with scarcely an exception,
refused to pray for her; and if she had been
tried and sentenced by the Privy Council of Scotland
or by the Scottish Parliament, the Catholic laity
alone would have attempted to save her. But the
manner of her trial and condemnation was regarded
as a national affront; and when the Estates met in
July 1587 the peers offered to give their lives and
fortunes to avenge the fate of the Scottish queen,
who, after eighteen years of captivity in England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had perished at the hands of Englishmen. During
the autumn and winter the Borders were in a state of
dangerous excitement. An invasion from Scotland
was expected. Preparations were made for raising
ten thousand men to repel it; and there appears to
have been some idea of rebuilding the old Roman
wall.<a name="Anchor-40" id="Anchor-40"></a><a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a></p>

<p>The indignation expressed by James at the treatment
which his mother had received was doubtless
not altogether feigned. But the great aim of his life
now was to secure his own succession to the throne of
England; and Walsingham adroitly availed himself
of this circumstance for the purpose of preventing
war. Sir John Maitland, a younger brother of
Maitland of Lethington, was the Scottish Secretary,
and to him Walsingham wrote a letter, which he
knew would be read by James, and in which, with
consummate art, he proved that if the youthful King
of Scots wished to reach the object of his ambition,
he must maintain his friendship with England.<a name="Anchor-41" id="Anchor-41"></a><a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The resentment of James died speedily away.
On various occasions, during the remainder of
Elizabeth’s reign, the relations of the two countries
were strained, and there was bad blood between
the sovereigns. But there was no open rupture;
and at last the house of Stuart entered peaceably,
and without opposition, on the rich heritage
of the English Crown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE UNION OF THE CROWNS</h3>


<p>A few years before the Union of the Crowns,
James, in the <i>Basilikon Doron</i>, that quaint little
volume of “Instructions to his dearest sonne,
Henry the Prince,” had alluded to the dangers
which were caused by the divided state of the
island. “As for the Borders,” he wrote, “because
I know, if ye enjoy not this whole Isle, according
to God’s right and your lineal descent, ye
will never get leave to brooke this North and
barrenest part thereof; no, not your own head
whereon the crown should stand! I need not in
that case trouble you with them; for then they
will be the middest part of the Isle, and so as
easily ruled as any part thereof.” Hitherto a
royal marriage had been the favourite plan for
removing these dangers; but after this we enter
upon a series of attempts to bring about an Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of a more complete and definite character. James
came to the throne of England with his mind full
of the subject. The people of Scotland anticipated
the removal of the Court to London with dismay.
But to the king it opened up a dazzling prospect
of power and splendour; and he lost no time in
proposing the Union, and pressing it, in season
and out of season, with a persistency which brings
out, in a remarkable manner, the strong individuality
of his character.</p>

<p>For some time before the death of Elizabeth,
James had been doing his best to gain the goodwill
of the English people; and as soon as he
received the official announcement of his accession
he directed his Privy Council to proclaim the
news, not only in order that the fact that he was
now King of England as well as Scotland should
become known, but in the hope, as the proclamation
expressed it, that there might be kindled
in the hearts of all Scotsmen “ane loveing and
kyndlie dispositioun towardis all his Majestie’s
subjectis inhabitantis of England.”<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> Nor did he
fail to impress this sentiment on the people. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the last Sunday which he spent in Scotland he
went to the Church of Saint Giles, where, when
the sermon was ended, he made a speech to the
congregation. It was regarded as a farewell,
and was received with “such a mourning and
lamentation of all sorts, as cannot well be
expressed.”<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a></p>

<p>“There is no difference,” he said, to cheer his
weeping subjects, “betwixt London and Edinburgh;
yea, not so much as betwixt Inverness or Aberdeen
and Edinburgh, for all our marches be dry, and
there are ferries between them. But my course
must be betwixt both, to establish peace, and
religion, and wealth betwixt the countries.”</p>

<p>The departure of James meant a great deal to
Scotland. When the day came, and the cannon
were booming from the old castle of Edinburgh,
the citizens assembled in multitudes to gaze at
the brilliant company of courtiers who were to
accompany their king upon his journey to the
south; but the spectacle was one which excited
many fears and few hopes. The Union of the
Crowns was making great changes. The Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was leaving. The queen remained behind with
the young Princes and the Princess Elizabeth;
but it was known that they were soon to follow,
and that, henceforth, they would live in England.
Their old Scottish home, the ancient palace of
Holyrood, was being dismantled already; and
soon nothing would remain in the royal apartments,
but some stray pieces of furniture, and a
few yards of faded tapestry. It was true that
to Scotland there was still left that independence
which had been so hardly won. The Parliament
remained in the same position as before; but a
new official was spoken of, a Royal Commissioner,
who was, in future, to represent the sovereign at
the meetings of the Estates. The separate Scottish
Executive, too, was to be continued, in the shape
of the Privy Council; but it was to be divided
into two parts, the one to sit in England, and the
other in Scotland; and it was evident that, in
future, the real centre of influence in Scottish
affairs would be London.</p>

<p>To some of the Scottish people the future
seemed very bright. During the reign of Elizabeth,
there were seldom so many as a hundred Scotsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in London at any one time. But now
politicians like the future Earl of Haddington,
at that time Lord Advocate Hamilton, saw that
in the wide field which lay before them, greater
things could be done than within the narrow
bounds of Scotland. George Heriot, who followed
the king to England, doubtless knew that he
could hold his own, and add to his wealth, among
the merchant princes of London. Gay young
men, like Lord Dalgarno in <i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i>,
looked forward to the amusements and dissipation
of London, and to the chance of filling their
empty pockets by marriages with English heiresses.
And among the humbler members of the royal
retinue there were not a few adventurers who
were glad to visit England, and share the spoil
with their betters. So great, indeed, was the rush
of Scotsmen to England, that soon after the
accession a proclamation was issued that no
Scotsman was to cross the Tweed, or sail for
England, without a passport from the Privy
Council.<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> But those who remained behind, and
especially the tradesmen of Edinburgh, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
supplied the Court, saw no chance of gain, but
rather much risk of loss, in the change which was
taking place.</p>

<p>In England, though James himself was received
with demonstrations of loyalty, his Scottish
followers were regarded with mingled contempt
and hatred. Scotland, it was said, was a land
where the nobles were beggars, and the merchants
were pedlars. The coarsest satire was poured
forth against the barren and unknown territory
from whence the new king had come. Indeed it
is difficult for us, in the nineteenth century, to
realise the scornful way in which Englishmen
spoke of Scotland, though we may form some idea
of the language which was used from the specimens
which have been preserved of what was actually
printed, circulated, and probably believed at that
time. “The air,” thus runs one of those productions,
“might be made wholesome, but for the
stinking people that inhabit it. The ground might
be made wholesome, had they wit to manure it.
Their beasts be generally small, women excepted,
of which sort there are no greater in the world....
As for fruits, for their grandam Eve’s sake they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
never planted any, and for other trees, had Christ
been betrayed in this country, as doubtless he
should have been, had he come as a stranger
amongst them, Judas had sooner found the grace
of repentance than one tree to hang himself on....
The Scriptures, they say, speak of elders and
deacons, but not a word of deans and bishops.
Their discourse is full of detraction, their sermons
nothing but railings, and their conclusion, heresy
or treason.... They christen without the cross,
marry without a ring, receive the Sacrament without
reverence, die without repentence, and bury
without divine service.”<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a></p>

<p>And even among those Englishmen who knew
that the popular ideas of Scotland were erroneous,
there was a profound feeling of jealousy lest James
should fill too many of the places about the Court
with his countrymen. It was suspected that if he
got his own way, almost every Scotsman in London
would soon be clad in velvet and satin, and wearing
a costly beaver instead of a blue bonnet; and
James took great pains, for a long time after his
accession, to assure the English courtiers that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
had no intention of promoting Scotsmen over the
heads of Englishmen. “I was ever rooted,” he wrote
to Lord Cranbourne, “in that firm resolution never
to have placed Scottishmen in any such room, till,
first, time had begun to wear away that opinion
of different nations; and, secondly, that this jealous
apprehension of the Union had worn away; and,
thirdly, that Scotsmen had been brought up here
at the foot of Gamaliel.”</p>

<p>Before James had been many days in England
he issued a proclamation, in which it was announced
that there was to be a complete Union of the
Kingdoms. “In the meane tyme,” he said, “till
the said Union be established, his Majestie doth
hereby repute, hold, and esteeme, and commandes
all His Highnesse subjects to hold and esteeme,
both the Two Realmes as presently united, and as
one Realme and Kingdome, and the subjects of
both as one People, Brethern, and Members of one
Bodye.”<a name="Anchor-46" id="Anchor-46"></a><a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a></p>

<p>The personal peculiarities of James, which
amounted to eccentricities, his firm belief in the
maxims of his own <i>Basilikon Doron</i> and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
complete abhorrence of the doctrines which
Buchanan, in the old days, had tried to teach him,
are prominent features of the controversy concerning
the Union. The tenacity with which he clung
to his conception of the royal prerogative is nowhere
more apparent than in his speeches and proclamations,
and in everything he did for the purpose
of forwarding his favourite scheme. When the
Parliament of England was found to be less subservient
than he had expected, he pointed to
Scotland as an example. “This I must say for
Scotland,” he exclaimed, “and may truly vaunt
it; here I sit and govern it with my pen. I write,
and it is done; and by a clerk of the council I
govern Scotland now, which others could not do
by the sword.” These were not altogether idle
words; but it would have been wiser to refrain
from boasting of a supremacy such as the
proudest of the Tudors had never ventured to
claim.</p>

<p>In the formidable contest against the national
prejudices of Englishmen, on which he was about
to enter, James secured a powerful ally. Bacon
had been one of those who received the honour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
knighthood on the day of the coronation; and he
lost no time in taking the king’s side on the
question of the Union, which he supported with
the subtilty of a scholiast, and with the broad
views of a statesman and philosopher. To the
debates in Parliament, to the Council Board of the
Commission on Union, to the famous discussion, in
the Exchequer Chamber, on the question of the
post-nati, he brought all the resources of his mind,
and threw himself into the struggle with an
enthusiasm which could not possibly have been
feigned. He played the part, though without
success, which was afterwards played by Somers
in the reign of Anne; and he seems, from the
very first, to have perceived with the eye of
genius exactly how far it was safe to go in the
direction of abolishing international distinctions.</p>

<p>His first contribution to the cause of the Union
was to impress upon the king the exact state of
the case, and what were the various points which
would have to be decided. The kingdoms were,
he showed, already united in religion and in
language. No sea rolled between them. The
same king reigned over both. But, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
there were separate Parliaments, separate Councils
of State, and separate offices of the Crown. There
was one peerage for England, and another for
Scotland. There were two very different systems
of law, and each country had its own peculiar code
of legal procedure. All these various institutions,
and, in addition, a mass of minor details of greater
or less importance, would have to be considered in
adjusting the terms of Union.<a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a></p>

<p>On the knotty question of whether there should
be an uniformity of laws, Bacon, from the outset,
in opposition to the opinion of the judges and
of the majority of English lawyers, maintained
that, while the public law of the United Kingdoms
should be assimilated, the private law of each
country should be left untouched; a conclusion
which was arrived at a century later, when the
Union was actually accomplished. “For,” he said,
“that which concerneth private interest of <i>meum</i>
and <i>tuum</i>, in my opinion, it is not at this time to
be meddled with. Men love to hold their own as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
they have held, and the difference of this law
carrieth no mark of separation.”<a name="Anchor-48" id="Anchor-48"></a><a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a></p>

<p>But before a single step could be taken, the two
Parliaments had to be consulted. James shrewdly
calculated that if the Parliament of England could
be gained, the Scottish Estates would readily
agree to his wishes. He accordingly wrote to
the Privy Council of Scotland, in January 1604,
informing them that the English Parliament was
to meet in March, when the project of an Union
would be discussed, and telling them to call the
Scottish Parliament together about the end of
April; and he gave express commands that no
subject except the Union was to be considered.
If the Estates agreed, as he assumed they would,
to the desirability of an Union, they were to
appoint commissioners to meet with commissioners
who would, by that time, have been appointed by
the Parliament of England.<a name="Anchor-49" id="Anchor-49"></a><a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a></p>

<p>The English Parliament met on the 19th of
March. The speech in which James recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Union was long, and had evidently been
prepared with great pains. What God had joined,
he urged, no man should put asunder. “I am
the husband,” he said, “and the whole island is
my lawful wife. I am the shepherd, and it is my
flock. I hope, therefore, no man will be so unreasonable
as to think that I, that am a Christian
king under the gospel, should be a polygamist
and husband of two wives.” Apart from some
grotesque illustrations such as this, the speech
was well worthy of the occasion. But the king’s
proposals were not cordially received; and it
was only under considerable pressure that, at
a conference of both Houses, a Commission
was appointed. At the head of the Commission
was Lord Chancellor Ellesmere; and among the
members were Robert Lord Cecil and Sir Francis
Bacon. They were empowered to consult with
commissioners to be appointed by the Parliament
of Scotland concerning an Union of the Kingdoms,
and such other matters as, upon mature
deliberation, should appear necessary for the
honour of his Majesty and the common good of
both realms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scottish Parliament, which had been
summoned to meet in April in order that it
might approve of the Union and appoint commissioners,
was prorogued from time to time,
and did not meet for business until the beginning
of July, when the Estates assembled at
Perth.</p>

<p>James had directed the Scottish ministers to
make the Union the only subject of deliberation,
and had also promised that the expenses incurred
by the commissioners from Scotland would be
defrayed out of his own purse. The Estates,
however, had no sympathy with the policy of the
king. The nobles grumbled among themselves,
and would fain have resisted. But the royal
orders were peremptory; and thirty-two commissioners
were appointed to “confer, treat, and
consulte upon a perfyte Unioun of the realmes of
Scotland and England.”<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> The first name on the
Commission was that of John, Earl of Montrose,
Lord Chancellor of Scotland; and among his
colleagues were a number of distinguished men.
Alexander Seton, then known as Lord Fyvie, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
afterwards the first Earl of Dunfermline. James
Elphinstone, Secretary of State, had recently been
raised to the peerage as Lord Balmerino, a title
associated, in Scottish history, with a long series
of family misfortunes, which culminated in the
execution of his descendant, the last lord, after
the Rebellion of 1745. Sir Thomas Hamilton,
whom James nicknamed “Tam o’ the Cowgate,”
was then Lord Advocate, and, after holding
almost every great office of State in Scotland,
became Earl of Haddington in the reign of
Charles the First. Another place in the Commission
was occupied by Sir Thomas Craig of Riccarton,
author of the <i>Jus Feudale</i>, whose Latin history
of the Union, which has never been published,
is preserved in the Library of the Faculty of
Advocates.</p>

<p>Some of the terms which occur in the Act
appointing these commissioners are such as to
suggest the idea that James himself had been
the draughtsman. The Estates, in language not
usually to be found in the statute-book, declare
that the Act is passed in order that “as the present
age is ravished in admiration with an so fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
beginning, so that the posterity may rejoice in
the fruition of such an effectual Union of two
so famous and ancient Kingdoms, miraculously
accomplished in the blood and person of so rare
a monarch.”</p>

<p>But the Estates, while ready to lavish praise on
the king, were determined that the Union was
not to interfere with the independence of Scotland.
It was noticed that while the English Act for
the Union contained a clause declaring that his
Majesty had no intention of altering the fundamental
laws and customs of England, nothing had
been said as to preserving the laws and customs
of Scotland. This was regarded as suspicious;
and there was inserted in the Scottish Act a
provision that the commissioners were to take
care that nothing was done which was inconsistent
with the ancient rights and liberties of
Scotland.<a name="Anchor-51" id="Anchor-51"></a><a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a></p>

<p>There was also passed, at the same time, a
statute which provided that the Commissioners on
Union should have no power to treat “in any
manner of way that may be hurtful or prejudicial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to the religion presently professed in
Scotland.”<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a></p>

<p>The commissioners, who had thus been appointed
by the Parliaments, were summoned to meet in
the Painted Chamber at Westminster in October.<a name="Anchor-53" id="Anchor-53"></a><a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a>
But James, too impatient to await the result of
their deliberations, and resolved to carry matters
with a high hand, issued a long and wordy proclamation,
in which he stated that he thought fit
to abolish the names of England and Scotland,
and to assume, “by the force of our royal prerogative,”
the title of King of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland.<a name="Anchor-54" id="Anchor-54"></a><a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> This title was to be used
in all public documents. The Borders were in
future to be known as the Middle Shires. A flag
was to be prepared bearing the Cross of Saint
George and the Cross of Saint Andrew. New coins,
with such mottoes as “Quæ Deus conjunxit nemo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
separet,” and “Henricus rosas Jacobus regna,” were
to be struck at the Mint in honour of the Union.</p>

<p>This proclamation was most unpopular in both
England and Scotland. The judges were of
opinion that the adoption of the title of King of
Great Britain would invalidate all legal processes.<a name="Anchor-55" id="Anchor-55"></a><a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a>
The king soon found that he had gone too far;
and, after a time, he consented to wait until his
wishes could be accomplished with the sanction of
Parliament.</p>

<p>On the 20th of October, the Commissioners on
Union met at Westminster. “A grave and
orderly assembly,” is the account which Bacon
gives of them. On the English side the lead was
taken by Bacon and Cecil; while of the Scottish
commissioners, Sir Thomas Hamilton and Lord
Fyvie seem to have been the most prominent.
It was soon evident that the Scottish peers were
afraid that the Union would diminish their own
power, and indifferent to the commercial advantages
which it would confer upon their country.
The commoners from Scotland also had their
doubts about the Union. They entirely failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
appreciate the benefits of the colonial trade which
it would open up; and they seem to have resented,
to an extent which blinded their judgments, the
removal of the Court to London.</p>

<p>The English commissioners also put obstacles in
the way of an agreement. Against the advice of
Bacon, but with the support of the judges, they
insisted on an uniform system of laws for the two
countries; a proposal to which the representatives
of Scotland would not listen.<a name="Anchor-56" id="Anchor-56"></a><a href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> They also maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that it was unreasonable that Scotsmen
should be made capable of holding offices under
the Crown in England; and on this point there
was a keen argument.</p>

<p>After a series of discussions, which lasted for
about five weeks, Bacon and Sir Thomas Hamilton
were instructed to embody the findings of the
commissioners, in the form of a Treaty of Union,
for the approval of the Parliaments. “It is
curious now,” says Professor Masson, “to imagine
the great English philosopher and ‘Tam o’ the
Cowgate’ thus seated together, for perhaps two
or three evenings, over the document which was to
descend to posterity as the draft Treaty of Union
between England and Scotland, and to speculate
how shrewdly ‘Tam o’ the Cowgate’ must have
looked after the substance of the document, while
he may have deferred to Bacon’s superior expertness
in strictly English idiom and wording.”<a name="Anchor-57" id="Anchor-57"></a><a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>The Articles of Union, as finally settled, stood
thus. All hostile laws, and, in particular, the
Border laws, were to be repealed. The name of
the Borders was to be abolished. There was to be
complete freedom of trade between England and
Scotland; and as regarded foreign commerce
both countries were to stand on the same footing.
On the difficult point of naturalisation, the commissioners
recommended that an Act should be
passed to declare that all subjects of both countries
born since the death of Elizabeth, that is to say
the “post-nati,” were, by common law, entitled to
the privileges of subjects in both countries. The
“ante-nati,” or subjects born before the death of
the late queen, were to enjoy the same privileges,
not at common law, but under an Act of Parliament
passed on their behalf. But the ante-nati were
not to be capable of holding offices under the
Crown or sitting in Parliament, except in the
country of their birth. In short, the post-nati
were to be fully naturalised; but the ante-nati
were not to have a share in the government or the
legislature.</p>

<p>This question of naturalisation, with the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
drawn between the post-nati and the ante-nati,
is, in our day, only one of faint antiquarian
interest; but it was then a question of practical
everyday importance. The law officers of the
Crown had given an opinion that the post-nati of
Scotland were not aliens in England, but that
the ante-nati were; and this had led the Union
Commissioners to suggest that both should be
placed on the same footing, with the exception,
which has just been mentioned, that the ante-nati
should be declared incapable of holding office.
At this point James raised an objection. He
protested that he had no desire to give offices of
State except to the natives of the country in which
the office was to be exercised. He agreed to the
proposal of the commissioners; but, at the same
time, he insisted that the clause dealing with the
question of naturalisation should be so worded as
to recognise a right on the part of the sovereign
to grant letters of denization. This, of course,
was a palpable evasion of the proposed finding,
and would leave him free to do as he pleased.
Nevertheless, the commissioners recommended
that, in the Articles of Union, the prerogative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the Crown as to appointing to offices in either
kingdom, and as to granting letters of denization,
should be specially reserved.</p>

<p>The Articles of Union were signed and sealed
by the commissioners on the 6th of December,
and at once presented to the king. James was
in high spirits. He thanked the commissioners
warmly for their services, and especially for their
conduct in reserving his prerogative of appointing
to offices in either kingdom. “Among other
pleasant speeches,” says Bacon, “he showed unto
them the laird of Lawreston,<a name="Anchor-58" id="Anchor-58"></a><a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> a Scotchman, who
was the tallest and greatest man that was to be
seen, and said, ‘Well, now we are all one, yet none
of you will say, but here is one Scotchman greater
than any Englishman’; which was an ambiguous
speech, but it was thought he meant it of
himself.”</p>

<p>The Governments in both countries began to
make arrangements for the approaching Union.
A warrant was issued for destroying the Great and
Privy Seals of Scotland; and new seals were made
with the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
quartered on them.<a name="Anchor-59" id="Anchor-59"></a><a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> Agents were sent to France
to investigate the privileges held by Englishmen
and Scotsmen as to the French trade, and arrange
for the future. An order was issued which illustrates
the position of affairs between the countries.
Scotsmen were constantly going abroad to serve
in the foreign armies. They were in the habit of
passing through England, and, on their way, they
often were guilty of disorderly conduct, such as
robbing on the highways, and committing other
outrages, which raised a bad feeling against their
country. It was therefore ordered that, in future,
all Scotsmen going abroad were to embark from
Scotland, instead of passing through England.<a name="Anchor-60" id="Anchor-60"></a><a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a></p>

<p>A long time, however, was to pass before the
subject of the Union was discussed by the
Parliaments. The English Parliament had been
summoned for the 5th of November 1605, when
the articles were to have been debated. But the
discovery of the Gunpowder Plot threw everything
else into the shade; and though the Treaty of
Union was presented, nothing more was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, when the Parliament of England met in
November 1606, it was understood that the session
was to be chiefly devoted to the Scottish question.
The Articles of Union were known; and there
was a storm of opposition from the merchants of
London. Objections were raised to the admission
of Scotsmen as members of English trading
companies. There was also a strong dislike to
allowing free trade between England and Scotland.
The Scots, it was said, would come and go as
they pleased, and fulfil or break their bargains just
as it suited them. The English traders, moreover,
wished a heavy duty to be imposed on cloth
entering Scotland, because Scotland had, for a long
time, been favoured in the custom duties which
she paid in France; and this, along with other
privileges she enjoyed in that country, might
enable her to monopolise the trade in cloth with
France. It was soon found that the dislike to the
Union extended to every class throughout the
country. There was a general fear that every
district, and every calling, would be overrun with
needy Scotsmen. The Articles of Union, it was
said, would open to Scotsmen not only trade, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the Church, the universities, and the highest offices
of State. They would fill, it was predicted, the best
stalls in every cathedral in England; Latin would
be taught at Oxford and Cambridge by the
countrymen of Buchanan, whose scholarship not
even English jealousy could venture to deny; and
the tireless energy of ambitious Scottish politicians
would secure the most lucrative places in the
Government.</p>

<p>In Parliament, and especially in the House of
Commons, these complaints were echoed. Sir
Christopher Piggott, one of the members for
Buckinghamshire, rose one day, and, speaking with
his hat on, launched into a torrent of abuse against
the idea of an Union with the Scots, who, he
shouted, were murderers, thieves, and rogues who
had not suffered more than two of their kings to
die peaceably in their beds during the last two
hundred years. The Commons, either from sympathy
or in surprise, received this tirade in silence.
But James, when he heard of it, was indignant;
and Piggott was expelled from the House and
committed to the Tower.<a name="Anchor-61" id="Anchor-61"></a><a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>In this spirit the debates, which began in
February 1607, were conducted by the opponents
of the Union. The first question which came up
was the question of naturalisation. The speech of
the member who opened the case against the
proposals of the Union Commissioners consisted of
an attack on Scotland and the Scots; and his chief
argument against the Union was that if a man
owned two pastures, the one fertile and the other
barren, he would not, if he was a wise man, pull
down the hedge, and allow the lean and hungry
cattle to rush in and devour the rich pasture.</p>

<p>Bacon led on the other side. The grand idea
of an orderly and well-balanced Union of the two
kingdoms had fascinated his imagination. In
moderate language, and in his most lucid manner,
he answered his opponents, and expounded his
own reasons for advising the Parliament of England
to naturalise the Scottish nation. There were, he
said, three objections to doing so. In the first
place, it was thought that if the Scots were no
longer aliens, they would settle in England in such
numbers that the country would be over-populated.
But, he answered, four years had passed since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Union of the Crowns, which was “the greatest
spring-tide for the confluence and entrance of that
nation”; and during these four years the only
Scotsmen who had come to live in England were
those immediately connected with the Court.
Again, England, he declared, was not yet fully
peopled. London was overcrowded; but the rest
of the country showed signs of a want of inhabitants,
in the shape of swamps and waste places. The
Commons themselves might bear in mind “how
many of us serve here in this place for desolate
and decayed boroughs.” And, besides, what was
the worst effect which could follow too great an
increase of the population? Nothing more than
some honourable war for the enlargement of our
borders.</p>

<p>The second objection to naturalising the Scots
was that the laws of England and Scotland were
different, that the Articles of Union left them
different, and that it was unreasonable to admit
the Scots to the privileges of English citizens without
making them adopt the laws of England. But,
he argued, naturalisation must come first. The
inhabitants of Ireland, of the Isle of Man, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Jersey and Guernsey, had the benefits of naturalisation;
but the laws of England were not yet in
force among them. An union of laws might be
brought about both in these places and in Scotland,
but only in course of time.</p>

<p>The third objection was that there was so much
inequality between England and Scotland that the
Union would not be fair to England. This inequality,
Bacon declared, consisted only in gold
and silver, the external goods of fortune. “In their
capacities and undertakings,” he said, “they are
a people ingenious, in labour industrious, in courage
valiant, in body hard, active, and comely.” If
Scotland was, after all, to gain by the Union, then
England might find that it was more blessed to
give than to receive.</p>

<p>Having thus answered the objections to naturalisation,
he next maintained that if naturalisation
did not follow the Union of the Kingdoms under
the same Crown, danger would be the result.
History, he argued, teaches us that whenever
kingdoms have been united by the link of the
Crown alone, if that union has not been fortified
by something more, and most of all by naturalisation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
separation takes place. The Romans and the
Latins were united; but the Latins were not made
citizens of Rome. War was the result. Sparta
was ruined by attempting to maintain a league
with States whose peoples she jealously regarded
as aliens. The history of Aragon and Castile, of
Florence and Pisa, taught us the same lesson. And
on the other hand, we find that where States have
been united, and that union strengthened by the
bond of naturalisation, they never separate again.</p>

<p>He ended his speech by saying that, in future
times, England, “having Scotland united and
Ireland reduced,” would be one of the greatest
monarchies in the world.<a name="Anchor-62" id="Anchor-62"></a><a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a></p>

<p>But this appeal was unheeded by the House; and
though Coke brought all his great authority as
a common lawyer to the same side as Bacon, the
members would not be convinced. James on two
occasions expostulated with them. He said he
was willing, if it would help on the Union, to live
one year in Scotland and another in England, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to live at York, or on the Borders. But the
Commons were intractable, although the Lords
were ready to agree to the Union, and to the
naturalisation of the Scots.</p>

<p>Something, however, was accomplished. The
questions of trade and of naturalisation were left
unsettled; but an Act was passed which gave effect
to the first part of the Treaty of Union, by repealing
a number of statutes hostile to Scotland (such as
those which forbade the leasing of lands to Scotsmen,
and the exporting of arms or horses to
Scotland), on condition that the Scottish Parliament,
when it met, was to repeal the Scottish Acts, of a
similar nature, which were hostile to England.<a name="Anchor-63" id="Anchor-63"></a><a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a></p>

<p>With this small concession James had to be
contented; and at the beginning of July he dismissed
the Parliament, but not without a farewell warning
that the Union was, in the long-run, inevitable.
“These two kingdoms,” he said, “are so conjoined
that, if we should sleep in our beds, the Union
should be, though we would not. He that doth
not love a Scotsman as his brother, or the Scotsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that loves not an Englishman as his brother, he
is traitor to God and the king.”</p>

<p>The Scottish Parliament met in the first week
of August. The Scots were, on the whole, rather
proud to think that their king had gone to rule
over England. Yet the old wrongs could not
easily be forgotten, and it is probable that the
Estates were very nearly as much against the
Union as the House of Commons was. The
Privy Council had, some months before, given the
king a hint of this;<a name="Anchor-64" id="Anchor-64"></a><a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> and a trivial circumstance
may be mentioned to show how jealous the Scots
were of England. A pattern of the new flag which
James had ordered to be prepared for the United
Kingdom, had been sent from England; and great
offence had been taken when it was found that
the Cross of Saint Andrew was covered, and, it
was said, hidden by the Cross of St. George.
Scottish seamen, the king was told, could not be
induced to receive the flag.<a name="Anchor-65" id="Anchor-65"></a><a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be little doubt that most Scotsmen
sympathised with the national feeling which this
trifling incident disclosed. But the private opinion
of a member of the Scottish Parliament was one
thing, and his public conduct was another. The
Estates were submissive to the royal will. The
Articles of Union were agreed to; and all the laws
hostile to England were repealed.<a name="Anchor-66" id="Anchor-66"></a><a href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a></p>

<p>Thus, so far as it lay within the power of the
Scottish Parliament, the king had got what he
wanted. All that remained was for the English
Parliament to be equally complaisant; and the
kingdoms would have been united in 1607 instead
of a century later. But it was not to be. In
neither country was there any genuine desire for
union. The free traditions of the House of
Commons enabled the members to say what they
thought; and the subject, gradually dropping out
of sight, was not again seriously debated during
the reign of James. The antiquary may still
inspect a brown and shrivelled parchment which
is preserved in the Register House at Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
all that remains of the Treaty of 1607. The time
had not yet come when the Parliaments of the
two nations were to see that it was impossible for
the resources of Scotland to be developed while
she remained separate from England, and that it
was equally impossible for England to attain a
position of permanent security so long as Scotland
remained poor and discontented, debarred, by
commercial restrictions, from the advantages of
trade with the colonies and with England, and
with no outlet for that splendid energy of her
people which, after the Union, changed the
Lothians from a desert to a garden, made Edinburgh
famous throughout Europe as a school of letters,
and founded on the banks of the Clyde one of the
great commercial cities of the world.</p>

<p>The question of naturalisation, which could not
be left undecided, was settled by the judges in a
test case in the law courts. The action related to
a tenement in Shoreditch, and the point at issue
was whether the plaintiff, a child born in Scotland
since the Union of the Crowns, was an alien, and,
therefore, not entitled to bring an action for real
property in England. Bacon was the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
counsel for the plaintiff; and the most important
opinion was delivered by Lord Chancellor Ellesmere.
The Court, by a majority, found for the
plaintiff, holding that all the post-nati, or persons
born in Scotland since the Union of the Crowns,
were naturalised and entitled to all the rights of
Englishmen in England. The ante-nati, those
born in Scotland before the accession of James,
still remained in the position of aliens.<a name="Anchor-67" id="Anchor-67"></a><a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a></p>

<p>The effects of the removal of the Court to London
were apparent in Scotland for many years to come.
The houses of the nobles and the gentry were
neglected. Gardens and pleasure-grounds, which
had begun to appear in some places, were allowed
to run to waste. The inns, poor at all times, fell into
ruins. Merchants found their business at a standstill;
and the shipping trade languished. What
made all this peculiarly galling to the Scottish
people was that England, though not occupying
under the Stuarts the lofty position which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
occupied under the Tudors, was, year after year,
enlarging her bounds and adding to the sources of
her wealth. On the southern side of the Borders,
the industries of Yorkshire were showing signs of
what they were to become. The East India
Company, now firmly established, was extending
its operations. Far across the seas Nova Scotia
was colonised by Scotsmen whom poverty had
driven from their homes; and the plantations of
Virginia became a rich addition to the resources
of the English Crown. And besides suffering
from the evils of poverty, Scotland was harassed
almost from the day on which James ascended the
throne of England by those ecclesiastical disputes
which plunged the country into so much misery
during the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The king had been compelled, by the force of
public opinion in England, to abandon the Union.
But with the object to which he devoted the rest
of his life even those Englishmen who doubted the
wisdom of his policy were inclined to sympathise.
The Scottish Reformation, unlike that of England,
had been the work of the aristocracy, in opposition
to the Crown. It had, at the same time, been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
deeply religious movement; and these two forces,
working together, had developed, as the distinguishing
features of the Reformed Church of
Scotland, a denial of the royal supremacy in
ecclesiastical affairs, and the assertion of the
spiritual independence of the Church. Sir James
Mackintosh has said that the peculiar theories of
Berkeley were a touch-stone of metaphysical
sagacity, meaning, apparently, by this phrase,
that those who were without it could not understand
the meaning or the tendency of those theories.
In like manner, spiritual independence is the
touch-stone of a capacity for understanding the
history of the Scottish Church. The words
“spiritual independence” expressed for Scotsmen
what was, on the one hand, a part of their constitutional
law, set forth in the statutes of the
realm, and on the other hand, an article of faith,
received by the people as an essential part of their
religion, involving the principle of loyalty to the
great founder of the Christian faith, as the only
head of the Church. They believed&mdash;and for this
belief thousands laid down their lives&mdash;that there
were two authorities, the one civil and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
spiritual. Both were based upon a divine sanction;
and each was to be obeyed within its own sphere.
The civil magistrate was to bear rule and to be
obeyed in civil affairs; but if he attempted to
interfere with the spiritual jurisdiction of the
Church, he was to be resisted to the death. This
principle of spiritual independence, which, neither
at the Union of the Crowns, nor at the Union of
the Kingdoms, nor during that memorable crisis
which, in the middle of the nineteenth century,
rent asunder the Church of Scotland, Englishmen
were able to understand, was taught in the first
Confession of Faith drawn up by the Scottish
Reformers, and laid before the Estates in 1560.<a name="Anchor-68" id="Anchor-68"></a><a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a>
After some years, when the long controversy
between the king and the Church had begun, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
two jurisdictions, civil and ecclesiastical, were still
more carefully defined.<a name="Anchor-69" id="Anchor-69"></a><a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a></p>

<p>Principles such as these were intolerable to
James. By the law of England the king was
head of the Church; and it was, therefore, his
policy to introduce an uniformity of ecclesiastical
government over the whole island. For more than
twenty years before the Union of the Crowns he
had been engaged in fighting the Scottish clergy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Sometimes he won, and sometimes he was defeated.
The great point at issue was whether the Scottish
Church was to be Presbyterian or Episcopal; for
he had found that if the Presbyterian system was
allowed to exist, the royal supremacy would never
be acknowledged in Scotland. Accordingly he
came to the throne of England with a firm resolution
that he would use his new position so as to
secure the establishment of Episcopacy in the
north; and, though he artfully concealed it, we
may be sure that one of his chief reasons for
proposing the Union was that he believed it would
be followed by the accomplishment of this object.
Henceforth the policy of extending the Anglican
system to Scotland became the hereditary policy
of the Stuarts. Three years after the Union of the
Crowns, the boldest leaders of the clergy having
been driven into exile, the Scottish Parliament
acknowledged the royal supremacy over all persons
and all causes. It was not long before Episcopacy
was established; and James had the gratification
of seeing a few of his new bishops humbly consenting
to receive consecration from the hands of
English prelates, and returning to Scotland to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
confer upon their brethren the virtues of the
apostolical succession. But the system which
was thus set up had no hold upon the people.
It would be impossible to point out in the
catalogue of Scottish bishops the names of a dozen
men who were either popular, or famous for
learning, or eminent on account of their public
services. The history of Christendom contains no
story so humiliating as the story of Prelacy in
Scotland during the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The real meaning of the struggle between the
Scottish people and the English Government
which followed the Union of the Crowns cannot be
understood unless we remember that, for most of
those who suffered, the question at issue was a
question of conscience. It is easy to find upon
the surface of these events the materials from
which to construct an explanation of a different
kind. Envy at the sight of so much power in the
hands of the priesthood, and the love, so strong in
the Scottish character, of freedom from control,
might influence some. But no one who looks
below the surface, or reads the history of that
period with an impartial mind, can fail to perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that what brought the people of Scotland into a
position of such stern antagonism to the English
system of Church government, and, still more,
what kept them there, was the fact that to accept
Episcopacy was to give up spiritual independence,
to admit the royal supremacy, and to abandon
the principle of a divine head of the Church. It
was for that principle that men and women died
during the period between the Restoration and
the Revolution, and not merely in defence of one
form of Church government against another. And
in the meantime, during the first half of the
seventeenth century, it was the obstinate and
persistent tyranny of James, and the infatuation
of Charles the First and his advisers, which roused
that memorable outburst of national resentment
which scattered their policy to the winds. An
uniformity in Church government and in ritual
was the end aimed at by Charles and Laud. That
end was, indeed, so far accomplished; but not by
them. Having resolved to extend the Anglican
system permanently to Scotland, they lived just
long enough to see the Scottish system on the
point of being extended to England, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
kingdoms suddenly bound together by that
solemn league which, conceived, though it may
have been, in a spirit of intolerance, was nevertheless,
for more than two generations, the watchword
of the Whigs of Scotland, who afterwards, through
the years of darkness and tempest, held high the
blue banner of the Covenants, the rallying-point
of Scottish freedom.</p>

<p>During a few years the Presbyterian Church was
established, and the ecclesiastical affairs of Scotland
were administered in accordance with the long-cherished
aspirations of the native clergy. But
the alliance between the English Parliament and
the Scottish Parliament and Church did not long
survive the execution of Charles. Their ideas had
always been different. “The English were for a
civil league, we for a religious covenant,” Baillie
had written six years before. The Scottish Parliament
protested against the execution. The
Scottish Church was willing to receive Charles
the Second, if he would declare himself a
Presbyterian and sign the Covenants. “If his
Majesty,” Baillie writes, “may be moved to join
with us in this one point, he will have all Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ready to sacrifice their lives for his service.”
Charles consented. He subscribed the Covenants,
and bound himself, by an oath, to maintain the
Presbyterian Church. But the royal cause was
hopeless. Cromwell’s victory at Dunbar was a
crushing blow; and the battle of Worcester left
Scotland at the mercy of the English army.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE UNION DURING THE COMMONWEALTH</h3>


<p>When the battle of Worcester was fought exactly
a year had passed since the battle of Dunbar.
The events of that year were not such as to
reconcile Scotland to the Union which was now
proposed by the Government of England. All
trade between the two countries had been forbidden.
Edinburgh had been taken, the royal
palace of Holyrood, turned into barracks, had
been set on fire through the carelessness of the
soldiers, and almost totally destroyed. The
churches had been desecrated, their pulpits and
seats torn down and used as firewood. The
edifice which George Heriot had directed his
executors to raise for the benefit of the poor of
Edinburgh was seized, while still in the builder’s
hands, and turned into a military hospital. The
castle had been surrendered into the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
invader. In the Parliament House, English
troopers prayed and preached. The garrison of
Stirling Castle had capitulated; the public records
of the kingdom had been removed to the Tower
of London; and the whole country south of the
Forth and Clyde was subdued. Dundee held out
to the last; but just two days before the battle of
Worcester the town was stormed by Monk.</p>

<p>The slaughter at Dundee, and the news brought
home by those who had escaped from the field
of Worcester, extinguished all hopes of further
resistance. In the Highlands alone there remained
some faint show of adherence to the
cause of the Stuarts, which afterwards found an
outlet in the rising under Glencairn; and the
Marquis of Argyll strove, for a time, to stem the
tide which was overwhelming Scotland. But, to
all intents and purposes, the country was now
thoroughly subdued.</p>

<p>Eight commissioners, among whom were young
Sir Harry Vane, Lambert, and Monk, were appointed
to arrange an Union. They found everything
in confusion. The last meeting of the
Scottish Parliament had taken place on the 6th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of June. The Court of Session had not sat
since February 1650. Many towns were without
magistrates. The Church was torn by internal
dissensions. When proclamation was made, at
the market-cross of Edinburgh, that Scotland was
to be united, in one Commonwealth, with England,
the announcement was received in gloomy silence.
But there was an under-current of feeling in favour
of the Union, of which the commissioners were
doubtless aware. Delegates from the counties
and burghs were summoned to meet at Dalkeith,
to consider the Tender of Union which the
commissioners were empowered to offer on
behalf of the Parliament of England; and the
result was that, of thirty-one counties, twenty-eight,
and of fifty-eight burghs, forty-four assented to
the Union.<a name="Anchor-70" id="Anchor-70"></a><a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> Their assent must in some degree
be ascribed to motives of prudence; for it was
known that those counties and burghs which
failed to send delegates favourable to union
would be disfranchised; but it was from Glasgow
alone, which, more than any other place in Scotland,
was ultimately to benefit from the Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with England, that any formal and serious objection
came. By some a scheme was suggested,
which Fletcher of Saltoun would have warmly
supported in 1707, for declining an incorporating
Union and making Scotland a republic in friendly
alliance with England. But the proposers of this
scheme, one of whom was the noted Covenanter,
Sir Archibald Johnston of Warriston, ultimately
agreed to the Union.</p>

<p>The chief opponents of the new arrangement
were the clergy. It was on the 23rd of February
1652 that the delegates assembled at Dalkeith;
and on the following day Baillie writes: “All the
ministers of Edinburgh prays still for the king,
and preaches very freely and zealously against the
way of the English; this they are very angry at,
and threatens to remeed it.” But the ministers
were divided against each other. Some resisted
the Union because they were Royalists, some
because they could not tolerate the idea of uniting
with a country in which the Independents and
other “Sectaries” had so much power, and others
because they thought that the result of the Union
would be that the Church would become subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to the State. But their resistance was of
no avail; and they could only lament the defection
of so many of the laity. “Good Sir John Seaton,”
Baillie writes in reference to the Conference at
Dalkeith, “was the first that subscribed his free
and willing acceptance of the incorporation for
East Louthian. The two Swintons followed for
the Merse, Stobs for Tiviotdale, Dundas for West
Louthian, William Thomson and Fairbairne, I
think, have done the like for Edinburgh, and its
like almost all burghs and shyres will, under their
hand, renounce their Covenant; Glasgow and the
West purposes to refuse, for which we are like
deeply to suffer; but the will of the Lord be done.”<a name="Anchor-71" id="Anchor-71"></a><a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a></p>

<p>The result of the meeting of delegates was
reported to Parliament; and the Council of State
was instructed to prepare a Bill for the union of
the two countries. Deputies were sent from
Scotland to Westminster to adjust the details of
the measure, and, in particular, to fix the number
of members who were to represent Scotland in the
Parliament of the United Commonwealth. A
series of conferences were held between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
deputies and a Committee of Parliament, at which
the demands of Scotland were discussed. There
was great difficulty in settling the question of
representation.<a name="Anchor-72" id="Anchor-72"></a><a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> The English proposal was that,
in the united Parliament, England should be
represented by four hundred members, Scotland
by thirty, and Ireland by thirty. The number of
commoners in the Scottish Parliament had been
one hundred and twenty; and the deputies wished
sixty Scottish members to have seats in the House
of Commons. The English Government, however,
refused to admit more than thirty. This was
agreed to; and the Union Bill was about to pass,
when, on the 20th of April 1653, Cromwell put an
end to the Long Parliament.</p>

<p>In the Little Parliament, Barebones’ Parliament,
Scotland was represented by five members, and
some progress was made in the matter of the
Union. It was resolved that there should be
complete free trade between England and Scotland.
The Government ordered all money raised in
Scotland to be spent in Scotland for local purposes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><a name="Anchor-73" id="Anchor-73"></a><a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a>
and that on the passing of the Union Bill, an
enactment, which had come into force three years
before, under which all Scotsmen were banished
from England, should be repealed.<a name="Anchor-74" id="Anchor-74"></a><a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> But the
further progress of the Union Bill came to an end
when Parliament was dissolved, and the control of
all affairs passed into the hands of Cromwell as
“Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England,
Scotland, and Ireland,” a title which assumed that
the Union had already taken place.</p>

<p>In the following spring an ordinance was framed
for completing the Union. It set forth that the
people of Scotland, having been invited to unite
with England, had, through their deputies, accepted
the invitation; that Scotland was, therefore, to be
now incorporated and declared one Commonwealth
with England; and that, in every Parliament
which was held for the Commonwealth, thirty
members were to serve for Scotland. To secure
the more effectual preservation of the Union, and
the freedom of the country, the people of Scotland
were relieved from all allegiance to the Stuarts.
The title of King of Scotland was abolished. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
right of the Estates to assemble in Parliament was
annulled. It was ordained that, “as a badge of
this Union,” the arms of Scotland should form a
part of the arms of the Commonwealth; and that
all seals of office, and the seals of the corporations
in Scotland, should henceforth bear the arms of
the Commonwealth. All taxes were to be levied
proportionably from the whole people of the
Commonwealth. Vassalage was abolished, and
lands were to be held by deed or charter for rent.
The whole system of hereditary jurisdictions, by
which there had been transmitted from father to
son, in many families of the landowners, the power
of holding courts and inflicting punishments, even
that of death, was swept away. An immense boon
was conferred on Scotland by the establishment of
complete free trade between the countries, and by
the declaration that in all matters relating to
commerce England and Scotland were thenceforth
equal.<a name="Anchor-75" id="Anchor-75"></a><a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a></p>

<p>This ordinance was proclaimed at Edinburgh on
the 4th of May 1654. The town-cross, at which
the ceremony took place, was surrounded by troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
under the command of Monk. An immense crowd
of the townsfolk assembled to witness the proceedings.
The Lord Provost and the Magistrates,
clad in their scarlet robes, were in attendance.
Henry Whalley, Judge Advocate to the English
army, read the proclamation; and at the conclusion
of the ceremony, Monk and his friends were entertained
at a sumptuous banquet in the Parliament
House, where the Magistrates stood and served
them. Later in the evening there was a display
of fireworks at the town-cross.</p>

<p>The Union having been thus proclaimed, the
Council of State at Whitehall proceeded to arrange
the distribution of seats in Scotland.<a name="Anchor-76" id="Anchor-76"></a><a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> Of the
thirty seats, twenty were allotted to the counties,
and ten to the burghs. The more populous
counties each returned a member. The rest were
divided into groups. Of the burghs, Edinburgh
alone returned two members; but all the other
towns were grouped into districts.</p>

<p>When the Protector’s first Parliament met, in
July 1654, twenty-one members from Scotland
attended. Of these, both the members for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Edinburgh, and several others, were Englishmen;
and while the Union lasted, the members from
Scotland were either quiet and peaceful Scotsmen,
ready to support the Protector’s measures, or
English officials.<a name="Anchor-77" id="Anchor-77"></a><a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a></p>

<p>The Council in Scotland managed the elections
there. The full number of thirty members was
returned to the Parliament of 1656; but many of
them were Englishmen. Argyll opposed the
Council, and endeavoured to secure the return of
Scotsmen only, but in vain. He failed to obtain
a seat himself until Richard Cromwell’s Parliament
of 1658, when thirteen county and eight burgh
members seem to have attended. Argyll then
represented Aberdeenshire in the House of
Commons; but the members for Perthshire,
Inverness-shire, Linlithgow, Stirlingshire, Clackmannan,
Dumbartonshire, Argyllshire, Bute, and
Midlothian were all Englishmen; and a majority
of the burgh members came from Westminster
or the Inns of Court.<a name="Anchor-78" id="Anchor-78"></a><a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The executive government in Scotland, during
the Union, was vested in a Council of State, to
whom elaborate instructions were issued by the
Protector. They were to inquire into the best
means for preserving the Union; to promote the
cause of religion, taking care that the clergy were
regularly paid, and that all schools had able and
pious teachers; to encourage learning and reform
the universities; to remove from the corporations
disaffected or ill-behaved magistrates, and replace
them by suitable persons; to see that equal
justice was administered to all men, and to promote
the Union by assimilating the procedure in
the courts of Scotland to that of the courts of
England; to investigate the state of the revenue,
and see that the Exchequer was not defrauded; to
study economy in the public service; to encourage
the fishing industry, the manufactures, and the
commerce of Scotland.</p>

<p>The Council consisted of nine members, of whom
only two, Lockhart and Swinton, were Scotsmen.
Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, third son of the
Earl of Cork, was President, with a salary of two
thousand pounds a year; and the great Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
offices of State, most of which were retained, were
generally filled by Englishmen. Lord Broghill
appears to have been popular. “He has gained,”
Baillie writes, “more on the affections of the people
than all the English that ever were among us.”<a name="Anchor-79" id="Anchor-79"></a><a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a></p>

<p>An army of English soldiers, nearly as numerous
as that which occupied Ireland, was spread over
Scotland. Forts were built at Leith, Glasgow,
Ayr, and Inverness; and the castle of Inverlochy
was repaired and filled by a garrison which overawed
the Western Highlands. The strictest
discipline was maintained. “I remember,” Burnet
says, “three regiments coming to Aberdeen.
There was an order and discipline, and a face of
gravity and piety among them, that amazed all
people.” Burnet attributes the flourishing state
of Scotland during the Union to the money spent
by the army; so does Fletcher of Saltoun. And
it must have had a considerable effect on the
financial state of the country, as the pay of the
troops amounted to two hundred and fifty thousand
pounds yearly, an immense sum for the Scotland
of those days.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>In the judicial system sweeping changes were
introduced. The exercise of jurisdiction in
Scotland was prohibited, except under the
authority of the Parliament of England. The
powers of the Court of Session, the supreme
tribunal of the country, were handed over to a
bench of Commissioners for the Administration of
Justice to the People of Scotland. These judges
were seven in number, four Englishmen and three
Scotsmen. At first the Scottish Bar joined the
clergy in opposing the Union, and refused to
plead; but by the autumn of 1656 most of the
advocates had returned to business.</p>

<p>The manner in which the “English judges,” as
the Commissioners were called, performed their
duties seems to have given great satisfaction.
The Court of Session had been so tyrannical and
corrupt that the fairness and purity of the new
Court astonished the country. “Justice,” we are
told, “was wont to be free and open for none but
great men, but now it flows equally for all.”
Circuit courts were held throughout the country;
and, while crime was firmly punished, the extreme
severity of the Scottish criminal system was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
avoided. Prosecutions for witchcraft were still
frequent, but the English judges received the
evidence with suspicion; and on one occasion
no less than sixty persons, whom the superstition
of their own countrymen would have condemned
to the flames, were acquitted.</p>

<p>The merchants of Scotland were, by the terms
of the Union, admitted to all the trading privileges
which Englishmen enjoyed. Goods of every
description passed duty-free from England to
Scotland and from Scotland to England; and
there was no restriction on the foreign and colonial
trade of Scotland. But these advantages were
not fully appreciated; for Scottish commerce was
still in its infancy. The Glasgow of to-day, with
its miles of wharves and warehouses, its forest of
masts, its shipbuilding yards, its crowded streets
and handsome squares, had no existence. The
merchants of the small town upon the Clyde
traded with Ireland, in open boats, for meal, oats,
and butter. They shipped coal, herrings, and
woollen goods to France in exchange for paper
and prunes. They sent to Norway for timber,
and to Barbadoes for sugar. But the river Clyde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was then so shallow that their ships could not
come nearer to the town than a spot fourteen
miles distant, where they were unloaded, and the
cargoes carried up the river on rafts or in small
boats.</p>

<p>The English were astonished at the poverty
of Scotland. The whole revenue from Customs
and Excise was under fifty thousand pounds a
year.<a name="Anchor-80" id="Anchor-80"></a><a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a> A monthly assessment of seventy thousand
pounds was levied in the towns and counties of
England, while Scotland was assessed at only six
thousand pounds. The yearly expenditure in
Scotland exceeded the revenue; and the balance
was paid out of the English treasury. Nevertheless
the time of the Union during the Commonwealth
was regarded as a time of prosperity. The trade
of Glasgow began to flourish. Leith, then the
chief port in Scotland, Dundee, and Aberdeen
made considerable progress in wealth; and there
can be little doubt that if the commercial policy
of Cromwell had not been reversed at the Restoration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the merchants of Scotland would have made,
during the second half of the seventeenth century,
that remarkable advance towards opulence and
importance which they made after the Union
of 1707.</p>

<p>When, fifty years later, the Union was finally
accomplished, one of the most difficult questions
which the statesmen of the two countries had to
discuss was the question of the Church. But the
ordinance of April 1654 contains no reference to
that question. The Council for Scotland was
instructed, in general terms, to promote the cause
of religion, and to see that the clergy were paid
regularly; but no formal settlement was attempted.
Though the stipends of the Scottish clergy were
small, their social position was far higher than that
of the English clergy. They associated, on terms
of equality, with the first families of the laity, and
so great was their influence that, if they had been
united among themselves, they might have held
their own against the Independents who came to
Scotland with Cromwell. But they were powerless,
because they were divided, split up into two parties,
and engaged in a dispute which was conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with a warmth unusual even in the quarrels of
Churchmen.</p>

<p>This dispute had its origin in the Engagement
for the relief of Charles the First. The Scottish
Parliament of 1649 had passed an Act which
declared all those who approved of the Engagement
incapable of holding any public office.<a name="Anchor-81" id="Anchor-81"></a><a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> This
statute, known as the Act of Classes, had incapacitated
a number of persons from serving in
the army. After the battle of Dunbar, the General
Assembly passed resolutions in favour of readmitting
to the public service, particularly in
military employments, those who had been proscribed;
and Parliament, taking the same view as
the majority of the clergy, repealed the Act of
Classes. Against this the defeated minority of the
clergy protested. Two parties were formed, the
one known as Resolutioners, and the other as
Protesters; and the contest passed from the ranks
of the clergy to the ranks of the people. Which
party had the larger following among the people
it is difficult to say; but, apparently, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Resolutioners formed a majority of the clergy, the
Protesters were more popular, especially in the
south-western counties, afterwards the stronghold
of the Covenanters during the period which followed
the Restoration.</p>

<p>The Church of Scotland was rent in twain, and
there were two factions in almost every parish.
The induction of a minister was seldom accomplished
without opposition; and on many occasions
disgraceful scenes took place in the churches, riots,
stone-throwing, and even bloodshed. The differences
between the parties extended from the
original cause of quarrel to questions of rites and
ceremonies, always a fruitful source of bad feeling.
The country was flooded with controversial
pamphlets, in which the disputants attacked each
other in the most acrimonious terms. One of the
Protesters, indeed, a young divine named Binning,
published a book on <i>Christian Love</i>, in the hope,
apparently, of preparing the way for a reconciliation,
but his advances were rejected with scorn.</p>

<p>Some members of the Council of State proposed
that means should be taken to re-unite these
factions; but Vane advised a very different course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Let them fight it out, he said, in the inferior courts
of their Church. By this means their attention
will be diverted from secular matters, with which
they are too fond of interfering, and confined to
their own private squabbles. At the same time,
if we forbid the General Assembly to meet, they
will be powerless for either good or evil. This
policy was carried into effect. The Assembly met
at Edinburgh, and the members were about to
proceed to business, when an officer entered, and
asked by what authority they had met. Was it
by the authority of the Parliament of England, or
of the commander of the English forces, or of
the English judges in Scotland? The ministers
answered that the Assembly was an ecclesiastical
court, deriving its authority from God and established
by the law of the land. The officer said
that he had orders to dissolve the meeting, and
ordered those present to follow him, or he would
drag them by force out of the room.</p>

<p>Uttering protests against this violence, the
members rose and followed him. A guard of
soldiers surrounded them, and led them along the
streets, “all the people gazing and mourning, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at the saddest spectacle they had ever seen.”
Presently a halt was called. The names of the
ministers were taken down; and they were told
that all future meetings were forbidden. On the
following morning, by sound of trumpet, they were
commanded to leave the town, on pain of instant
imprisonment if they disobeyed.<a name="Anchor-82" id="Anchor-82"></a><a href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a></p>

<p>In this summary fashion the supreme court of
the Church of Scotland was dissolved; and while
the Union lasted the English army was supreme in
Church affairs. The clergy were forbidden to pray
for the king, and ordered to pray for the Protector.
This order was at once obeyed by the Protesters;
but the Resolutioners did not submit until they
were informed that their stipends would be withdrawn,
when they came to the conclusion that as
the king could not protect them nor pay them
they need no longer pray for him. Excommunication
lost its terrors when the secular arm could no
longer be invoked to give civil effect to the sentence
of a Church court. The stool of repentance, which
stood in every church, and on which sinners had
to sit and listen to a public rebuke, was derided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
by the rough troopers, who either broke it to
pieces, or sat on it themselves, to show their
contempt for a kind of discipline which was akin
to penance in the Church of Rome. The English
soldiers did not admire either the Church or the
religious character of the Scots. “A Kirk whose
religion is formality, and whose government is
tyranny, a generation of very hypocrites and vipers
whom no oaths or covenants can bind, no courtesies
or civilities oblige,” was their verdict.<a name="Anchor-83" id="Anchor-83"></a><a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> Magnificent
and fruitful of results as the Covenanting movement
was, there can be no doubt that side by side with
the genuine religious devotion of some there was
to be found the deep hypocrisy of others. Cromwell
saw this at once, and complained that where he
had expected to find “a conscientious people,”
he had found one “given to the most impudent
lying and frequent swearing, as is incredible to be
believed.”<a name="Anchor-84" id="Anchor-84"></a><a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a></p>

<p>The persecuting principles of the Scottish clergy,
too, alienated the Independent ministers who
accompanied the army. Even so good a man as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Samuel Rutherford argued against toleration with
almost as much bigotry as Edwards had displayed
in the Gangræna; and Baillie lamented that “the
hand of power is not heavy on any for matters of
religion.”<a name="Anchor-85" id="Anchor-85"></a><a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> Principles such as these were, of course,
hateful to the Independents, with whom liberty of
conscience was an article of faith; and the fact
that such principles were held by the Scottish
clergy was one of the chief reasons why, during
the Commonwealth, the Scottish Church was
powerless.</p>

<p>Among the duties intrusted to the Council of
State for Scotland were the encouragement of
learning and the reform of the universities. Commissioners
visited the universities, and changes
were made. Resolutioners were turned out, and
Protesters put in their places. Leighton, afterwards
Bishop of Dunblane, became Principal of Edinburgh
University. At Glasgow, Patrick Gillespie
was appointed against the remonstrances of Baillie
and his party; but even Baillie afterwards admitted
that the appointment was a wise one. “The
matters of our college,” he writes, “this year were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
peaceable; our gallant building going on vigorously;
above twenty-six thousand pounds are
already spent upon it; Mr. Patrick Gillespie,
with a very great care, industrie, and dexterity,
managing it as good as alone.” A grant of
two hundred pounds a year was made to the
Universities both of Edinburgh and of Glasgow;
and before his death the Protector had taken the
first steps towards founding a College of Physicians
for Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1659 it was resolved to put the Union, the
terms of which rested only on the ordinance
promulgated by Oliver Cromwell five years before,
on a more constitutional footing; and for that
purpose two Bills “for perfecting the Union
between England and Scotland” were brought
into Parliament.<a name="Anchor-86" id="Anchor-86"></a><a href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a> But neither of these Bills
became an Act of Parliament; and at the
Restoration, the Union came to an end.</p>

<p>As to the general effect of this Union on the
state of Scotland we have conflicting accounts;
but the weight of evidence goes to show that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was a time, not only of quiet, which has never
been denied, but also of prosperity. Baillie tells a
dismal tale. The peers were in exile or reduced
to poverty; the people were burdened by heavy
taxation, and suffering from want of money and
want of trade. But Baillie was a Resolutioner;
and the Protesters were favoured by the Government.
Therefore, for Baillie, the times were out
of joint, and he exclaims, “What shall we do for
a testimony against the English?” Yet he is
forced to admit that food was cheap and plentiful;
and he gives an account of the state of Glasgow,
where he lived, from which it appears that the
town was highly prosperous. The magistrates
were rapidly paying off the public debt, and
spending money on public works.<a name="Anchor-87" id="Anchor-87"></a><a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a></p>

<p>To the historian Kirkton, who was on the other
side, everything seemed bright. It was a period
of “deep tranquillity.” Every parish had a
minister; every village had a school; almost every
family had a Bible. The voice of singing and of
prayer was heard in every house. From the
taverns alone came the sound of lamentation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for the happiness and sobriety of the people
were such that the trade in strong drink was
ruined.<a name="Anchor-88" id="Anchor-88"></a><a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a></p>

<p>Burnet agrees with Kirkton. “We always
reckon,” he says, “those eight years of usurpation
a time of great peace and prosperity.” Defoe
took special pains to make himself acquainted
with the affairs of Scotland, and the information
which he received was to the same effect. “Scotland
flourished, justice had its uninterrupted
course, trade increased, money plentifully flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in.”<a name="Anchor-89" id="Anchor-89"></a><a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> Cromwell himself, in 1658, gave a favourable
account of the state of things, on which Carlyle’s
comment is, “Scotland is prospering; has fair play
and ready-money;&mdash;prospering though sulky.”<a name="Anchor-90" id="Anchor-90"></a><a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a></p>

<p>In England the Union, if not unpopular, was
regarded with indifference. In the Protector’s
“House of Lords” there were three Scotsmen, Lord
Casselis, Sir William Lockhart, and Johnston of
Warriston, the last of whom seems to have wearied
the House with long and frequent speeches. In
the House of Commons the members from Scotland
gave no trouble, and are said, indeed, never to
have opened their lips. The commercial advantages,
however, which Scotland had secured by
the Union caused great jealousy among the
English merchants; and on the English side of
the border the establishment of free trade between
the countries was viewed with disfavour. But, on
the whole, the broad current of English life flowed
on, undisturbed by the existence of the Union.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FROM THE RESTORATION TO THE REVOLUTION</h3>


<p>At the Restoration the advisability of continuing
the Union was discussed. In England it was
maintained that the smaller country must give up
its Parliament and its separate system of laws, or
that it must, at all events, make the first advance,
and say definitely on what terms it would unite.
In Scotland it was foreseen that not only would
the native Parliament and the native laws be
destroyed in the event of a union, but that also,
in all probability, the Church would be sacrificed.
But the prosperity which the country was beginning
to enjoy might have reconciled many of the people
to these changes.<a name="Anchor-91" id="Anchor-91"></a><a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a></p>

<p>The Restoration was hailed with joy by the
nobles, who hoped that they would again have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
their Parliament and their Privy Council, by means
of which their families were aggrandised, and their
hereditary jurisdictions and feudal rights, which
gave them so much authority over their tenants
and retainers. The clergy, smarting under the
indignities to which they had lately been subjected,
and believing that Charles would keep
faith with them and establish Presbytery, welcomed
the change, and at once began to pray again for
the king. Clarendon, however, was of opinion
that the majority of Scotsmen were in favour of
the continuance of the Union. He himself was
in favour of leaving things as they were. “But
the king,” he says, “would not build according to
Cromwell’s models, and had many reasons to
continue Scotland within its own limits and bounds,
and sole dependence upon himself, rather than
unite it to England with so many hazards and
dangers as would inevitably have accompanied it,
under any government less tyrannical than that
of Cromwell.”<a name="Anchor-92" id="Anchor-92"></a><a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a></p>

<p>Lauderdale, whose influence in Scottish affairs
was now well-nigh supreme, was strongly in favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of removing all traces of the Commonwealth
government. To begin with, he insisted that the
fortresses which Cromwell had built should be
demolished and their garrisons withdrawn. The
time might come, he told the king, when he would
be in need of Scottish garrisons in England, and
to maintain an English army in Scotland would
alienate the affections of the Scottish people. The
fortresses were, accordingly, dismantled, and the
army of occupation was disbanded. Every trace
of the Union soon disappeared. The Estates met
in the Parliament House once more; and the
judges took their places on the bench of the Court
of Session.</p>

<p>On the question of the Church, Lauderdale’s
advice was not followed. His view was that,
instead of aiming at an Union, either civil or
religious, between the two countries, the object of
the Government should be to disunite them by all
possible means, and, at the same time, to keep the
people of Scotland in good humour by giving
them whatever form of Church government they
wanted, in order that they might be willing to
serve the king, if necessary, against the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of England. Such was the advice of Lauderdale.
Charles himself, though he detested Presbytery,
was at first inclined to take it. But, in the end,
the intrigues of the Episcopal faction prevailed;
and it was resolved to establish an Episcopal
Church in Scotland. The Chancellor explained
to Lauderdale that it was intended to set up only
a modified form of prelacy. “My Lord,” he
sternly answered, “since you are for bishops and
must have them, bishops you shall have, and
higher than ever they were in Scotland.”</p>

<p>These words came true. If the statesmen of
England had asked, By what means shall we most
easily irritate and exasperate the Scottish people?
how can we alienate them from England? how
can we render the royal family unpopular? how
can we destroy the trade of Scotland, which is
beginning to improve? how can we throw the
country, which is settling down, back into anarchy
and confusion? how can we most successfully
unite against the Church of England the whole
body of the Scottish people? how can we produce
a profound distrust in all measures which are
proposed by the Council in London? by what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
means, in short, can we best make the people of
Scotland disloyal, poverty-stricken, and rebellious?&mdash;if
these questions had been asked, some evil
councillor might have answered them thus: Pass,
he might have said, an Act of Parliament which
will destroy their commerce; abolish the Union,
and thus destroy free trade between them and the
English; restore to the owners of the soil the
jurisdictions by means of which they tyrannised
over their dependants in the past, and by means
of which they will be able to tyrannise over them
in the future; restore the tenure of lands by
military service, and thus you will, in a few years,
people every hamlet over a large portion of the
country with restless and idle clansmen, whose
only business in life is to foment feuds between
their masters, and to seek plunder for themselves;
above all things, let the king destroy the Presbyterian
Church which he swore to establish when
he took that solemn vow, on the faith of which the
crown of Scotland was placed upon his head; let
the great noble whose hands performed the act of
coronation, and to whom a Dukedom and a Garter
were promised, be accused of treason for a tardy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
compliance with the usurper, and let the rules of
legal procedure be strained in order to procure his
condemnation; eject from their livings the clergy
whom the people trust; let enormous fines, far in
excess of what the country can bear, be inflicted
on every class for the offence of nonconformity;
punish with death those who listen to the clergy
preaching in the fields because you have driven
them from the churches. All this, and a great
deal more, was done. The years which followed
the Restoration were the most miserable in the
history of Scotland. The great source of misery
was the desperate contest between the Episcopal
and the Presbyterian Churches; but the commercial
policy of the English Parliament is what chiefly
bears on the question of the Union.</p>

<p>Scotland had not suffered from the Navigation
Act of 1651, which forbade foreign ships to import
goods into England, or to trade with the colonies,
or even to visit them without special leave. This
statute was passed, in the words of Blackstone, “to
punish our rebellious colonies, and to clip the
wings of the Dutch.” It kept the colonial trade in
the hands of England, and increased the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
English shipping. The terms of the Union during
the Commonwealth had exempted Scotland from
its provisions. But now the Union was at an end,
and Scotland was once again a separate kingdom.
The Parliament of England proceeded to pass a
new and even more stringent Navigation Act,
which inflicted a deadly blow upon the trade of
Scotland.<a name="Anchor-93" id="Anchor-93"></a><a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a></p>

<p>Sir George Mackenzie traces the origin of this,
and other laws hostile to Scottish commerce, to
the fact that Clarendon and other English
politicians were piqued by the way in which
Lauderdale prided himself on having induced the
king to withdraw the army from Scotland against
their advice. “This excessive boasting,” he says,
“that he had prevailed in this over Hyde, Middletoun,
and all the English, did somewhat contribute
to renew the old discords which had formerly been
entertained between the two nations; and occasioned
the making of those severe Acts, whereby
the Parliament of England debarred the Scots
from freedom of trade in their plantations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
from enjoying the benefit of natives in the privilege
of shipping.”<a name="Anchor-94" id="Anchor-94"></a><a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a></p>

<p>The new law was so rigorous that no goods nor
produce, of any country, could be imported into
the colonies except from England or Wales.
Irish goods could not go from Ireland, nor
Scottish goods from Scotland. Moreover, the
most important products of a colony could
enter England, or another colony, only on payment
of duty. English ships alone were allowed to
carry goods to and from the colonies. The sugar,
the tobacco, the cotton, in fact all the most useful
produce of the colonies, could be shipped to
England only, and could not enter an English port
except in an English vessel. Nor could goods be
imported into England from the continent of
Europe except in English ships, or in ships belonging
to the country which actually produced them.</p>

<p>This monopoly, under which the colonies could
trade with England alone, was a grievance to the
colonies. They, however, had at least the privilege
of trading with England. But to the colonial
trade of Scotland the Navigation Act was ruinous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Other laws, hostile to the industries of Scotland,
were enacted. On some Scottish goods duties
were paid equal to, or above, their value. On
others a duty was charged very much greater
than the duty levied on the same articles when
they came from abroad. For instance, the duty
on Scottish salt was sixteen times that imposed on
foreign salt. Linen imported from Scotland was
now so heavily taxed that it hardly paid the
producer to bring it into England. In Northumberland
and Cumberland heavy customs were
levied on horses which came from Scotland; and,
on the plea that a great part of the richest pasture
land in England would fall in value if the graziers
of Scotland were allowed to find a free market in
England, Parliament was induced to cripple one
of the most important branches of Scottish industry
by imposing a fine of two pounds for every head
of cattle which crossed the border between the
24th of August and the 20th of December.<a name="Anchor-95" id="Anchor-95"></a><a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> And
there were many other enactments framed for the
purpose of excluding Scottish merchants, whose
operations were further embarrassed by a law under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which all goods sent from Scotland to England
must pass through either Berwick or Carlisle.<a name="Anchor-96" id="Anchor-96"></a><a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a></p>

<p>The commercial freedom which had been
enjoyed during the period of the Commonwealth
had quickened the commercial instincts of the
Scottish people, and had given them some idea
of what their country might become if they were
permitted to extend their traffic to the colonies,
those highly-favoured regions of the earth from
which so large a portion of the wealth of England
came. The recent Union had been attended by
circumstances which were humiliating; but for
many of these compensation had been found in
the prosperity which the Union had brought along
with it. The sudden change which the Restoration
had produced was, therefore, bitterly resented;
and the Scottish merchants persuaded the Estates
to retaliate by passing a Navigation Act for
Scotland, similar to the English Act, and by
imposing heavy duties on English goods.<a name="Anchor-97" id="Anchor-97"></a><a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> But
retaliation could not put Scotland in the same
position as England; and at length, after repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
complaints and demands, an Act was passed under
which commissioners from the two countries were
to meet and confer on the subject of a commercial
treaty.<a name="Anchor-98" id="Anchor-98"></a><a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a></p>

<p>In January 1668 the commissioners met. The
Scotsmen demanded that Scotland should enjoy
the privilege of trading to the English colonies
which was granted, by the Act of Navigation, to
the Irish and to the Welsh, and that they should
be allowed to bring in goods as freely as the
English, with no other restrictions than those laid
on Ireland and Wales. They were willing to
give assurances that goods transported from
English colonies would be brought to England,
except the small quantities which were consumed
in Scotland. A number of papers, containing
these and other demands, were presented by the
Scottish commissioners, and to these the English
commissioners returned written answers.</p>

<p>Apparently the conferences were on the point of
terminating abruptly within less than a month;
for, on the 29th of January, the Scottish commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
refused to go further until the question
of the Navigation Act was settled, and the English
refused to act until the whole of the Scottish
demands were laid before them. The Scottish
commissioners gave in, and presented a document
in which their grievances were set forth. The
repeal of the Navigation Act was what they
chiefly insisted on; but, in addition to this, they
complained of the whole of those Acts of Parliament
by which free trade between England and
Scotland had been abolished, and by which
excessive duties had been imposed on Scottish
produce. “Thus,” they said, “your lordships have
now the full scheme of all that is demanded by us
in this treaty. But because what we have given
in, relating to the Act of Navigation, was the first
in time, and is the greatest obstruction of our
trade, and indeed without which our trade cannot
be carried on, we still insist upon an answer to it
in the first place, and then we shall be willing to
proceed to treat on all the rest in order.”<a name="Anchor-99" id="Anchor-99"></a><a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>After a long delay the English commissioners
returned their answer. They refused, in peremptory
terms, to allow Scotland to trade with
the colonies. The colonies, they said, were founded
by Englishmen, and Scotsmen had no right to
benefit by them. They were prepared, however, to
permit Scotsmen to go and settle as merchants in
the colonies; but they refused to allow Scottish
ships to carry foreign produce into English ports.
“The kingdom of Scotland,” they said, “being
wholly independent, and not subject to the Crown
of England, we cannot have reasonable security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and satisfaction that the said kingdom will keep
up, and tie itself, to the strict observation of the
restrictions and limitations set down in the Act of
Navigation, with relation to this matter.”</p>

<p>They offered, nevertheless, to make some concessions,
on condition that those Acts of the
Scottish Parliament which imposed a tariff hostile
to English trade were repealed. If that were done,
Scottish ships might import fish into England
free of duty, and also tar, hemp, flax, raisins,
and grain of any sort, on payment of the duty
levied on aliens. They might also import timber
into England for six years; and the reason for
this concession was frankly stated to be that since
the great fire of London there had been a scarcity
of wood for rebuilding the city. They also offered
to give Scottish ships the right, for six years only,
of exporting goods from England, on payment of
the same customs as English ships paid.</p>

<p>These terms were refused by the Scottish
commissioners, who objected to the limitation of
six years, and declared that the Scots wished to
be, as they had been during the Union under
Cromwell, in a position to compete, on equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
terms, with the merchants of England. But the
English commissioners would not yield; and the
negotiations terminated without any result.</p>

<p>It was now evident that, so long as the two
countries remained separate, there could be no
genuine commercial prosperity in Scotland. It
was, therefore, natural that the question of Union
should be again revived. The project was first
suggested by a Scottish peer, whose advice in
other matters, if it had been taken, would have
saved the Privy Council of Scotland from much
of the blood-guiltiness which it incurred during
these years. John, second Earl of Tweeddale,
had been sworn of the Council at the Restoration,
but had frequently raised his voice on behalf of
the persecuted Presbyterians; and he had often
endeavoured to discover some means by which
peace could be restored to Scotland. His proposal
now was that the Scottish Parliament should
be called together, and invited to consider what
steps should be taken to unite the kingdoms. To
this Charles readily agreed, for he thought that if
the two Parliaments were merged in one, the Lords
and Commons who represented Scotland would, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a rule, support the measures of the Court. The
Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Keeper
Bridgeman were also in favour of this proposal.<a name="Anchor-100" id="Anchor-100"></a><a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a></p>

<p>It was, indeed, the interest of all whose fortunes
were bound up with the fortunes of the Royal
Family that Scotland should be conciliated. The
recent conferences had shown how strong the
feeling of Scotland was on the subject of trade;
and no candid-minded Englishman could deny
that the grievances complained of by the commissioners
from beyond the Tweed were real
grievances. It was true that the more powerful
nation was master of the field, and could, by
obstinately opposing the demands of her weaker
neighbour, debar her from the trade in which she
was so anxious to obtain a share. But the lessons
of the great Civil War had not been altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
forgotten at the Court; and, in the secret conclave
of the king’s advisers, there always had been,
ever since the Restoration, an uneasy feeling that
a day might come when the Crown would find
itself opposed by the Parliament. At such a
crisis much would depend on what was done by
Scotland. It was, therefore, of importance to
persuade the people of Scotland that, so far as
the king’s influence went, everything had been
done to remove the commercial disabilities of
which they so justly complained.</p>

<p>Lauderdale, who at the Restoration had supported
the policy of separation, was now eager
on the side of Union. No Parliament had met
in Scotland since 1663. It would be necessary
to summon the Estates together if the Union was
to be discussed; and Lauderdale coveted the
office of Lord High Commissioner. A Parliament
was, therefore, summoned. It met at Edinburgh
in October 1669. Lauderdale was Commissioner.
A letter from the king was read, in which the
Union was recommended to the favourable consideration
of the Estates; and his Majesty’s
servants proposed that an answer should at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
be returned, announcing that the Parliament of
Scotland was in favour of the Union. Some
opposition was offered by Sir George Gordon of
Haddo, then member for Aberdeenshire, and
afterwards first Earl of Aberdeen, and by Sir
George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, who a few years
later became Lord Advocate; but, in the end,
a letter was despatched in which the Estates
approved of the Union, and left it to the king
to name commissioners to treat upon the subject.
The Parliament of England took the same view;
and in September 1670, the commissioners met in
London.<a name="Anchor-101" id="Anchor-101"></a><a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a></p>

<p>Five questions were submitted to them: the
preserving entire to both kingdoms of their laws,
civil and ecclesiastical; the uniting of the two
kingdoms into one monarchy; the reducing of
both parliaments to one; the regulation of trade;
and the best means of preserving the conditions
of the Union.</p>

<p>The subject of trade, the most important of all,
was never reached; for, before very long, the
treaty broke down on the question of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
representation of Scotland in the Parliament
of the United Kingdom. The Scottish commissioners
proposed that all the members of the
Scottish Estates should be members of the
Parliament. To this the English commissioners
could not agree; and the proceedings came to an
abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p>During these negotiations the Scotsmen had
not been on very good terms with each other.
Lauderdale and Tweeddale quarrelled; and Sir
George Mackenzie says that the Lord Chancellor,
at dinner one day, abused two of the commissioners,
Sir Archibald Primrose, father of the
first Earl of Rosebery, and Sir John Nisbet, then
Lord Advocate, for walking on foot when they
had a handsome allowance for expenses, and
called them “damned lawyers.” They were
heard to express their resentment at this; whereupon
Lauderdale, who bore them a grudge as
supporters of Tweeddale, told them he would
accuse them to the king of trying to frustrate the
Union by causing bad feeling among the commissioners.
“And thus,” says Mackenzie, “in
place of uniting the nations, these wise commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
disunited themselves, and returned
to Scotland as men from a rout.”</p>

<p>However popular an Union might have been
among the Scottish merchants, it would have
been most unpopular in England. The English
merchants, who had exulted in the failure of the
Commission on Trade, were up in arms against the
idea of giving to Scotland the privileges which
she would have secured by the Union; and the
majority of Englishmen still hated and despised
the very name of Scotland. This hatred and
contempt of the neighbour country, an inheritance
from the long years of international warfare,
found vent in abusive descriptions of Scotland
and the Scottish people, which were circulated all
over the island, causing laughter in England and
rousing bitter indignation beyond the Tweed.
“The country,” says one writer, “is full of lakes
and loughs, and they are well stocked with
islands; so that a map thereof looks like a pillory
coat bespattered all over with dirt and rotten eggs,
some pieces of the shells floating here and there
representing the islands.” The towns of Scotland
were briefly described as poor and populous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
especially Edinburgh, which resembled its inhabitants
in “being high and dirty.” It was
compared to a double comb, an article which
Scotsmen did not often use, having one great
street, with a number of alleys branching from
it, which might be mistaken for common
sewers.</p>

<p>As to the Scottish women, “the meaner sort go
barefoot and bareheaded, with two black elf-locks
on either side their faces; some of them have
scarce any clothes at all, some part of their bed-clothes
pinned about their shoulders, and their
children have nothing else on them but a little
blanket. Those women that can purchase plaids
need not bestow much upon other clothes, these
cover-sluts being sufficient. Those of the best
sort, that are very well habited in their modish
silks, yet must wear a plaid over all for the credit
of their country.”</p>

<p>The English language could scarcely furnish
language violent enough for the purpose of
describing the Scots: “The people are proud,
arrogant, vain-glorious boasters, bloody, barbarous,
and inhuman butchers. Cozenage and theft are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in perfection among them, and they are perfect
English-haters. They show their pride in exalting
themselves and depressing their neighbours.
When the palace at Edinburgh is finished they
expect his Majesty will leave his rotten house at
Whitehall, and live splendidly among his own
countrymen, the Scots, for they say that Englishmen
are much beholden to them that we have
their king amongst us.”<a name="Anchor-102" id="Anchor-102"></a><a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a></p>

<p>If, in 1670, an Union had been accomplished by
the terms of which the people of Scotland had
obtained everything which they desired with
regard to trade, it would have been an immense
blessing to the country. But knowing what we
know of the councillors who surrounded the throne,
and of the character of the last two princes of the
house of Stuart, we may be perfectly certain that
an attempt would have been made to unite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Churches. In England, the Scottish Church
question was completely misunderstood; nay more,
to most Englishmen it was unintelligible. It was
known that there were troubles in the North; and
it was vaguely supposed that the Government had
to cope with false doctrine, heresy, and schism,
evils for delivery from which every good Anglican
was accustomed to pray. But few imagined that
month after month, and year after year, the
majority of the Scottish nation was being treated
in a manner which the majority of the English
nation would not have tolerated for a single week.
Even those Englishmen who had the best means
of knowing the truth had been totally deceived as
to the number and determination of the Presbyterians.
At the Restoration, Sharp had told the
Government that if Episcopacy was established
not more than twenty ministers would refuse to
conform. As a matter of fact, more than three
hundred gave up their livings. The parish
churches were deserted in many places by the
people, and meetings were held in private houses.
Not only was this declared to be illegal, but mere
nonconformity was made a crime; and the madness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the Scottish Privy Council may be seen from
the fact that any landowner who failed to attend
his parish church was fined a fourth of his rents
for the year in which he was convicted; while for
the same offence tenants and burgesses were fined
a fourth of their personal estates. Forbidden by a
law resembling the English Five Mile Act to live
within twenty miles of their parishes, within six
miles of a cathedral town, or within three miles of
a burgh, the ejected ministers took to preaching
in the fields. This was punished as sedition; and
the law was administered in so cruel and relentless
a fashion that, if the whole truth had been known
in England, there can be little doubt that indignant
remonstrances would have been addressed
to the Government; especially when, in 1670, the
Scottish Parliament passed an Act by which any
person who, without a licence from a bishop or
the Privy Council, preached or prayed at a field
meeting, was to be put to death,&mdash;a savage law
which was savagely executed. To the people of
England, however, very little of all this was
known.</p>

<p>Tweeddale possibly saw, in the abolition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Scottish Parliament, and in those reforms of the
Privy Council which might be expected to follow
an incorporating Union, some prospect that a
wiser and more moderate system of government
might be introduced. But the whole course of
Scottish history during the reigns of Charles the
Second and James the Second shows that nothing
less than that sweeping removal of every trace of
Prelacy which took place at the Revolution could
have restored peace and order to the country.
It is, therefore, well that the Union did not take
place at a time when the statesmen in both
countries, by whom the terms of Union would have
been arranged, were pertinaciously bent on establishing
a system of Church government which,
loved and honoured though it was in England,
was hated and despised in Scotland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE REVOLUTION SETTLEMENT</h3>


<p>After the failure of the treaty of 1670, eighteen
years, eventful in the history of both kingdoms,
passed; and at the Revolution the question of the
Union was again discussed.</p>

<p>In the letter which William addressed to the
Scottish Estates in March 1689, he said that he
was glad to find that many peers and gentlemen
of Scotland, whom he had consulted in London,
were “so much inclined to a union of both
kingdoms, that they did look upon it as one of the
best means for procuring the happiness of these
nations, and settling of a lasting peace among
them.” He himself was of the same opinion, and
was resolved to do everything in his power to
bring it about.</p>

<p>Among the members of the Estates there was a
strong party in favour of delaying the settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the Crown until the Union had been accomplished,
on the ground that terms favourable to
Scotland would be more easily obtained when the
affairs of England were in a critical and unsettled
condition. Among those who took this view was
Sir John Dalrymple, who afterwards, as first Earl
of Stair, was to play a prominent part in the final
settlement of the question. The fact, however,
that this view was supported by some astute
members of the Jacobite party, who saw in it a
means of causing delay, induced a majority of the
Estates to resolve that the settlement of the
Crown should come first.</p>

<p>William had instructed Melville, and his other
representatives in Scotland, that nothing was to
interfere with the settlement of the Government.
That was to be their first concern. If the Estates
were in earnest for the Union, care was to be taken
that it was not made an excuse for delay. If the
Union was insisted on, then an attempt must be
made to obtain from the Estates an offer of terms
such as the English Parliament was likely to accept
at once, without entering upon a treaty. He
indicated his own view to be that the laws and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
customs of Scotland should be preserved intact,
while questions relating to the public safety, and
also the proportion of Scottish members in the
united Parliament, should be referred to himself.<a name="Anchor-103" id="Anchor-103"></a><a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a></p>

<p>Although William thus anticipated a discussion
on the Union, he was determined that nothing
should prevent or delay the immediate settlement
of the Government. The resolution of the Estates
was, therefore, in accordance with his wishes. But
as soon as the memorable declaration that James
had forfeited his right to the Crown had been
adopted, along with the offer of the vacant throne
to William and Mary, the Estates lost no time in
taking up the question of Union; and an Act was
passed appointing commissioners “to meet with
such persons as shall be nominate commissioners
by the Parliament of England, and to treat concerning
the Union of the two kingdoms.” This
Act became law on the 23rd of April, and on the
following day a letter to the king was approved,
in which the Estates informed his Majesty that
certain of their number would wait upon him with
the offer of the Crown, and would present to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a Claim of Rights, and a list of grievances for
which they asked redress. At the same time they
expressed the hope that the Union would be
speedily accomplished, “that as both kingdoms
are united in one head and sovereign, so they may
become one body politic, one nation, to be represented
in one Parliament.”</p>

<p>The Scottish Estates had proposed the Union.
But at Westminster nothing could be done to
further their wishes. William alluded to the
question in his speech from the throne in March
1690. “I must,” he said, “recommend, also, to
your consideration a Union with Scotland. I do
not mean that it should now be entered upon; but
they having proposed this to me, some time since,
and the Parliament there having nominated commissioners
for that purpose, I should be glad that
commissioners might also be nominated here, to
treat with them, and so see if such terms could be
agreed on, as might be for the benefit of both
nations, so as to be presented to you in some
future session.”<a name="Anchor-104" id="Anchor-104"></a><a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> Nothing more, however, was heard
of the Union at that time. It was evident that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the affairs of both kingdoms were in such a state
that it was hopeless to press forward so delicate a
piece of business. In England, important questions
which could not be delayed awaited decision; and
in Parliament party feeling was running high, not
only between the Tories and the Whigs, but also
between the Lords and the Commons. In Scotland,
the factions which contended for the mastery would
only have found in the Union another question
about which to wrangle. The keen eyes of William
had perceived the necessity of the Union, but the
time had not yet come.</p>

<p>Although the project of an Union was abandoned,
the statutes relating to the Church passed by the
Scottish Parliament at this time, constituting what
is known as the Revolution Settlement, had a
most important bearing on the final accomplishment
of the Union. Prelacy was abolished, and Presbytery
was re-established. Most of the ministers who
had been ejected at the Restoration were now dead,
but sixty veterans still survived, and they were
restored to their livings. The Act which asserted
the royal supremacy in ecclesiastical causes was
repealed. The Westminster Confession of Faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was declared to be the national creed. The Law
of Patronage was reformed by an Act which gave
the Protestant landowners in counties, and the
town councils in burghs, power to buy the
patronage of livings, for a small sum; and the
right of choosing the minister was handed over
to the landowners and the elders, against whose
choice the congregation might appeal to the
Presbytery.<a name="Anchor-105" id="Anchor-105"></a><a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a></p>

<p>The statutes which introduced these reforms
were accepted by an overwhelming majority of the
Scottish people. In 1707 they were embodied in
the Act of Union; and it is certain that if, while
the terms of the great international contract were
being arranged, any serious attempt had been
made to alter them, the Union would never have
been accomplished.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, hardly possible to overestimate the
importance of the Church question during the
Union controversy. It is certain that if the Church
of the majority had not been established in Scotland
at the Revolution, another civil war would have
been the result. The Presbyterian clergy were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Whigs, almost to a man, and their influence in the
country was enormous. The views held by the
extreme branch of the Church did not affect, to
any great extent, the course of events in Scotland.
These were the men who, under their various designations
of Cameronians, or Hill men, or Society
men, still clung tenaciously to the old Covenanting
ideas in their most uncompromising form. They
could hardly bring themselves to submit to the
existing Government. The old formula of a
“Covenanted King” of the Stuart dynasty was
still full of meaning to them; and long afterwards,
during the reign of Anne, the Jacobites tried to
make use of them for the purpose of defeating the
Union. They were, however, Whigs, and would
never, under any circumstances, have acquiesced
in the overthrow of the Presbyterian system. The
great danger to the cause of the Union and the
Hanoverian succession lay in the sentiments of
the Episcopalians. Every Episcopal clergyman
in Scotland, with scarcely an exception, was a
Tory and a Jacobite. On the eve of the Revolution,
when the bishops of England were opposing, with
dignified firmness, the arbitrary pretensions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
king, the Scottish bishops had addressed him in
terms of the most servile eulogy. They assured
him that they regarded a steadfast allegiance to
the throne as an essential part of their religion.
They declared that the line of Stuart was the
greatest glory of Scotland. They spoke of James
himself as the darling of heaven, and described the
amazement and horror with which they had heard
the rumours of an invasion from Holland.<a name="Anchor-106" id="Anchor-106"></a><a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> It is
not wonderful that the Presbyterians, when they
obtained the ascendency, should have excluded
from power the authors of this address. Nor is it
wonderful that, in those parts of the country where
the persecutors had been at work, the peasantry
should have subjected the obnoxious clergymen
to every species of indignity. For more than a
quarter of a century their oppressors had appealed
to the law to justify their misdeeds, and it was
natural that, when the hour of deliverance came,
the oppressed should take the law into their own
hands. Locked out of their churches and expelled
from their houses, with their gowns torn from their
backs, the Episcopal clergy in Scotland learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
how precarious is the situation of a priesthood
which is protected by the law, but has no place
in the affections of the people.</p>

<p>The Church affairs of Scotland were not settled
in accordance with the desires of William. It was
no secret that he wished to secure complete
toleration for all dissenters. He was anxious to
avoid all measures which could interfere with the
projected Union of the Kingdoms; and it is probable
that his hope was that some plan might be devised
for establishing the same system of Church government
throughout the whole island. When he
received from the Government in Scotland the
draft of the Act which it was proposed to pass for
the establishment of Presbytery, he made a number
of amendments which had a double purpose; to
remove expressions which might raise doubts in
England with regard to the Union, and to conciliate
the Episcopalians in Scotland. For instance, it
was stated in the draft that the Reformation in
Scotland had been the work of Presbyters “without
Prelacy.” This statement he deleted. In the draft,
Presbytery was described as “the only government
of Christ’s Church in this kingdom.” William was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of opinion that a better expression would be “the
government of the Church in this kingdom
established by law.” The rest of his suggestions
were of a similar character. Everything in the
shape of an assertion that Presbytery was a better
system than Episcopacy was carefully avoided,
and the only reason given for establishing the
former was, that it was more in accordance with
the wishes of the Scottish people. At the same
time he explained that it was his desire “that those
who do not own and yield submission to the
present Church government in Scotland shall
have the like indulgence that the Presbyterians
have in England.”</p>

<p>The Act was submitted to the Estates, and
became law on the 7th of June 1690. It declared
Presbytery to be “the only government of Christ’s
Church within this kingdom”; it condoned the
action of the peasantry in expelling the Episcopal
clergy by force; and it placed the government of
the Church in the hands of the sixty ministers who
had been replaced in the livings from which they
had been ejected at the Restoration. Yet the
Government acted on tolerant principles. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Episcopal clergymen who took the oaths were left
in peaceable possession of their churches, without
being called on to submit to the Presbyterian
Church courts; and some even of those who
refused to take the oaths, and who prayed publicly
for the late king and his family, continued to enjoy
their livings without molestation.<a name="Anchor-107" id="Anchor-107"></a><a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> After a few
years, when it was seen that the Jacobites were
quite irreconcilable, an Act was passed which
provided that no one could hold a benefice without
taking the oath of allegiance, signing the assurance,
which was a declaration that William and Mary
were the only lawful sovereigns of the realm,
signing the Westminster Confession of Faith, and
submitting to the Presbyterian system of Church
government. Yet so lenient was the spirit of the
Whigs that, instead of vigorously enforcing this
law, they superseded it, to a great extent, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
another and milder Act, under which taking the
oaths to Government became the only qualification
required from any Episcopal preacher in Scotland.</p>

<p>At the Revolution, and in consequence of the
position in which the Episcopal clergy found
themselves, it became the fixed policy of the
Jacobites to call the attention of Englishmen to
what was going on in the North; and during the
reign of William there issued from the press a
series of pamphlets, the purpose of which was to
create a feeling against the Presbyterians so strong
that, if a favourable opportunity should occur, the
Scottish Establishment might be attacked and
overthrown. The first to take the field were “two
persons of quality.” Sir George Mackenzie, the
late Lord Advocate, and Lord Tarbat, afterwards
the first Earl of Cromartie, went to London at the
crisis of the Revolution, and published a pamphlet,
the purpose of which was to persuade the Prince of
Orange that the principles of the Presbyterians
were not only inconsistent with monarchy, but
even destructive of all human society.<a name="Anchor-108" id="Anchor-108"></a><a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
production did not attract much notice; but a
great effect was produced by a more elaborate
piece of work, to which Mackenzie devoted the
last months of his life. This was a vindication of
the system of government pursued in Scotland
during the reign of Charles the Second.<a name="Anchor-109" id="Anchor-109"></a><a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> It was,
in a measure, a vindication of his own life, for few
of the rulers of Scotland had taken a more important
part in the questionable transactions of
that reign. When his public career was ended by
the Revolution, he had retired to Oxford, where
Whigs and Tories alike were amused and instructed
by his conversation, in which he did not fail to
present the worst features of Presbytery.<a name="Anchor-110" id="Anchor-110"></a><a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> The
<i>Vindication</i>, the greater part of which was probably
written at Oxford, was a serious attempt to show
that the Executive Government in Scotland had
not been guilty of oppression and cruelty, that no
one had suffered on account of his religion, that
the Presbyterians were merely rebels, and that the
laws which had been made against them were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
only necessary, but had never been harshly
administered. He did not live to publish this
pamphlet himself, but after his death it was printed
by Dr. Alexander Monro, who had lately been
deprived of the place of Principal of the University
of Edinburgh. Coming from the pen of a well-known
member of the late Government, who had,
for a number of years, been the first law officer of
the Crown in the country about which he was
writing, the <i>Vindication</i> had great weight in
England.</p>

<p>Monro also published a tract of his own, defending
himself against charges made by the commissioners
who had been appointed to visit the Scottish
universities, and “purge” them of all professors
who would not swear allegiance to William and
Mary.<a name="Anchor-111" id="Anchor-111"></a><a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a> The effect of this work, and others upon
the same subject, was to raise a feeling of contempt
for the state of learning in Scotland, and to cause
Englishmen to believe that, under the Presbyterian
system, literature and science were doomed. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
pamphlets were published giving an account of
the proceedings in the General Assembly and in
the Parliament connected with the establishment
of the Church.<a name="Anchor-112" id="Anchor-112"></a><a href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a> These, certainly, contain materials
of great historical value; but they do not even
pretend to be impartial, and were written to
excite sympathy with the ejected Episcopal
ministers and dislike to their successors.</p>

<p>The author of one of these pamphlets, the Rev.
John Sage, wrote also an elaborate treatise on the
history and nature of Presbytery, in which he
maintained that the article in the Claim of Rights
which declared that Prelacy was a grievance, and
contrary to the inclinations of the Scottish people,
was utterly without foundation.<a name="Anchor-113" id="Anchor-113"></a><a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> The Presbyterians,
he asserted, had, in pursuance of a carefully-arranged
plan, encouraged the rabble to eject the
Episcopal ministers, and had managed, during the
confusion of the times, to secure a majority in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the Estates, which did not represent the wishes of
the country. It was obvious that if this could be
proved to the satisfaction of the Whigs of England,
they would, in any treaty of Union, consider
seriously whether the religious Establishment of
Scotland should not be brought into conformity
with that of England. If a majority of the people
desired Presbytery, the Whigs, on principle, were
bound to support Presbytery. But if neither the
mob nor the Parliament represented the wishes of
the people; if the real desire of the nation could
only be discovered by private consultations with
the Tory and Jacobite laity, or gathered from the
writings of the Episcopal clergy; if the majority
of the Parliament represented the minority of the
nation, then it was the duty of the Whigs to
support Episcopacy.</p>

<p>But the pamphlets which were most widely read
in England were those which held up the Presbyterians
to execration as persecutors, and to ridicule
as fanatics. Monro and his friends took great
pains to collect accounts of the hardships which
the Episcopal clergy had suffered at the hands of
the mob, and published them for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
influencing public opinion in England.<a name="Anchor-114" id="Anchor-114"></a><a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> The
clergy were described as “a company of resolute
Christians that dare lay down their lives for the
truth of those doctrines which they have formerly
taught.” In point of fact, none of them were
called upon to lay down their lives. One of the
worst cases of “rabbling,” which the Episcopalians
described as a “tragedy,” took place at Kirkpatrick
in Annandale. On Easter day a party of men
and women went to the clergyman’s house in the
morning, knocked him down, and then threw him
into “a nasty puddle.” His wife, who ran out of
the house, was also thrown down. “Then their
noble Captain at this honourable expedition gave
the word of command to his female janizaries,
which was <i>Strip the Curate</i> (for they think this a
most disgraceful appellation, and therefore they
apply it to all Episcopal ministers). The order was
no sooner given, than these Amazons prepared to
put it in execution, for throwing away their plaids
(<i>i.e.</i> loose upper garments) each of them drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
from her girdle a great sharp-pointed dagger,
prepared, it seems, for a thorough reformation.
The good minister lying panting and prostrate on
the ground, had first his night-gown torn and cut
off him, his close coat, waistcoat, and britches ript
open with their knives, nay, their modesty could
not so far prevail against their zeal, as to spare his
shirt and drawers, but all were cut in pieces and
sacrificed to a broken Covenant. The forementioned
Captain gave the finishing stroke
himself with a great Reforming Club, the blow
was designed for the minister’s head or breast, but
he naturally throwing up his hands to save those
vital parts, occasioned it to fall upon his shin-bones,
which he had drawn up to cover his Nakedness;
the blow was such as greatly bruised his legs, and
made them swell extraordinarily after; however
the Captain thinking they were broke, and finding
it uneasie for himself and his companions to stand
longer in a great storm of wind and snow which
happened to fall out that morning, he drew off his
company, and left the Semi-Martyr, who afterwards,
by the assistance of his servants, crawled home to
his bed, and but a little after, the whole herd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his persecutors broke in again upon him, and told
him: they had treated him so because he prayed
for the Tyrant York (so these people ordinarily
called King <i>James</i>, tho’ he was too kind to them),
and because he had presumed to preach and visit
the parishioners as if he had been their minister,
which they had formerly forbidden him to do;
they required him also to be gone from their
Covenanted Lands, under pain of death, before
that day Sevennight, and never again to meddle
with the ministry.”<a name="Anchor-115" id="Anchor-115"></a><a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a></p>

<p>Such stories&mdash;and this is only one of many which
were printed and circulated&mdash;could not fail to
produce anger and alarm in England; and the
conduct of the Presbyterian ministers was, at the
same time, represented in the most unfavourable
light. Not one of them, it was said, had ever been
heard to condemn these outrages from the pulpit.
On the contrary, sermons had been preached in
which the mob had been applauded for their zeal.
In the cathedral church of Saint Giles at Edinburgh
the congregation had been told that “such
shakings as these were the shakings of God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
without such shakings his Church was not in use
to be settled.”</p>

<p>But the sayings and the character of the
ministers of the Church of Scotland were assailed
in the most effective way by those writers who
relied upon ridicule rather than serious invective.
Londoners who remembered laughing over Hudibras
in the heyday of the Restoration must have
found the Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence very
poor reading. But it was admirably suited for
the purpose of persuading Englishmen that the
sermons and prayers of the Scottish ministers
were nonsensical rhapsodies, and that, in many
cases, both the preachers and their hearers were
hypocrites who led the most immoral lives. That
part of the work which attacked the private
characters of the Presbyterian ministers was met
by a series of accusations of the same kind against
the Episcopalians; and it is difficult to say
whether the attack or the defence is more discreditable.
Both are probably, on the whole,
equally mendacious.<a name="Anchor-116" id="Anchor-116"></a><a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> But the most telling part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the work consisted of selections from grotesque
sermons and prayers. “Sirs,” one minister is
reported to have said in his first sermon, “I am
coming home to be your shepherd, and you must
be my sheep, and the Bible will be my tar-bottle,
for I will mark you with it; (and laying his hand
on the clerk or precentor’s head) he saith, ‘Andrew,
you shall be my dog.’ ‘The sorrow a bit of your
dog will I be,’ said Andrew. ‘O Andrew, I speak
mystically,’ said the preacher. ‘Yea, but you
speak mischievously,’ said Andrew.” Another
minister, preaching on the first chapter of the
Book of Job, is represented as saying, “Sirs, I will
tell you this story very plainly. The Devil comes
to God one day. God said, ‘What now, Deel, thou
foul thief, whither are you going?’ ‘I am going
up and down now, Lord, you have put me away
from you now, I must even do for myself now.’
‘Well, well, Deel (says God) all the world kens
that it is your fault; but do not you know that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
have an honest servant they call Job? Is not he
an honest man, Deel?’ ‘Sorrow to his thank,’
says the Deel; ‘you make his cup stand full even,
you make his pot play well, but give him a cuff,
I’ll hazard he’ll be as ill as I am called.’ ‘Go,
Deel,’ says God, ‘I’ll yoke his honesty with you.
Fell his cows, worry his sheep, do all the mischief
ye can, but for the very soul of you, touch not a
hair of his tail.’”</p>

<p>The specimens of prayers are equally absurd.
“O Lord,” one divine says, “thou’rt like a mousie
peeping out at the hole of a wall, for thou sees us,
but we see not thee.” Another prayed as follows:
“Good Lord, what have ye been doing all this
time? What good have ye done to your poor
Kirk in Scotland?... O, how often have we
put our shoulders to Christ’s cause, when his own
back was at the wall; to be free with you, Lord,
we have done many things for thee that never
entered in thy noddle, and yet we are content
that thou take all the glory; is not that fair and
kind?”</p>

<p>The small quarto from which these extracts
are taken was only one, though it was the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
popular, of a series of similar lampoons. The
most offensive of these, a comedy written without
the wit, but with all the licentiousness of Wycherley,
was not printed for many years; but it may now
be read by anyone who wishes fully to understand
into what depths of malice and profanity some
men were driven by the party spirit of those
days.<a name="Anchor-117" id="Anchor-117"></a><a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a></p>

<p>The public opinion of England on the ecclesiastical
affairs of Scotland was, to a great extent,
formed by these publications. They increased the
hostility with which the High Church party regarded
the establishment of Presbytery. The
accounts of the outrages committed on the ejected
clergy caused a widespread feeling of sympathy
with them among all classes of Englishmen; and
the effect which they produced was not only
evident during the discussions on the Union, but
afterwards led Parliament to pass measures which
were most unpopular in Scotland, which endangered
the stability of the Union before it had lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
more than a few years, and which have been the
occasion of endless troubles, misunderstandings,
and secessions among the Presbyterians.</p>

<p>The Church question, however, was settled for
a time; and the people of Scotland, whose whole
energies had for so long been absorbed in the
struggle against religious tyranny, were now ready
to advance on the path of secular progress. But
the commercial policy of England remained unaltered.
The least hint that the Navigation Act
ought to be repealed raised an outcry among the
merchants of London. The proposals for an
Union, made by the Estates, had not been listened
to. Therefore Scotland, it appeared, must submit
to remain poor, while England became wealthier
and wealthier.</p>

<p>But now the self-reliant spirit of the Scottish
people rose. If they could not share in the trade
of England, they would establish a trade of their
own. If they were not to be the partners of
England, they would be her rivals. There can be
no doubt that the schemes of the Scottish Company
Trading to Africa and the Indies, on which the
hopes of the country were placed, were rash and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
visionary. Scotland, it is true, was an independent
country, with a Parliament of its own, with its own
church, laws, coinage, and taxation, united to
England by nothing except the Crown; and the
powers which the Scottish Parliament gave to the
Company brought this fact prominently into view,
for the Company was to have the right of arming
ships of war, building cities, making harbours and
fortresses, waging war, and concluding alliances.
But these very powers, which impressed on Scotsmen
the fact that their country was independent,
could not fail to rouse the alarm of Englishmen,
and particularly of English traders. The royal
assent had, indeed, been given to the statute by
which the Company was created.<a name="Anchor-118" id="Anchor-118"></a><a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> But the
merchants of England were so alarmed, so jealous,
so persuaded that their own trade was endangered,
that we cannot be surprised that William, whose
position depended entirely on the goodwill of
England, acted as he did; especially when, at a
time when he was deeply involved in continental
politics, the Company, by sending the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to Darien, so seriously imperilled his relations with
Spain.</p>

<p>The sum of money which was actually lost by
Scotland seems small in our day. The amount
appears to have been about two hundred and
twenty thousand pounds; but the Scotland of the
seventeenth century was far less able to bear the
loss of this sum, than the France of the nineteenth
century was to bear the loss of all the millions
which she, like her ancient ally, threw away upon
the shores of the Gulf of Darien. And rich as
England was, in comparison with Scotland, her
condition at this time was not so prosperous as to
make her liberal in dealing with other nations.
War had brought increased taxation; and our
enormous national debt, then beginning to accumulate,
was a source of constant alarm. In the
country districts farmers were suffering from a
long period of agricultural depression, and rents
were seldom paid in full. In the towns work was
scarce, and the price of bread was rising. The
carrying trade languished in spite of the monopoly
which English shipping enjoyed under the Navigation
Act, and the resistance to granting Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
what she chiefly demanded, a share in the colonial
trade, was increased by complaints which reached
this country from across the seas. The Scottish
shipowners, it was said, were landing goods in
America, and underselling the English merchants;
and to such an extent was this done, that Government
was called upon to send out men-of-war to
stop this illegal traffic.</p>

<p>And so once more England and Scotland were
at variance. The Lords and the Commons forgot
their quarrels, and combined to address the king
against the Scottish Company. William’s reply
was that he would endeavour to find some means
of escape from the difficulty which had arisen.
That no such difficulty could have arisen if there
had not been two Parliaments was perfectly clear.
The statute under which the Scottish colonists
sailed to Darien had received the royal assent, in
the Parliament House at Edinburgh, at a time
when the king was on the Continent. It was
possible that other measures of equal importance
to England might become law in the same way;
and the subject of the Union again begins to appear
in the correspondence of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“You may remember,” Marchmont writes, “your
Lordship was speaking a little to me about an
Union of the two Kingdoms. I have thought much
upon it, and I am of opinion that the generations
to come of Scotsmen will bless them and their
posterity, who can have a good hand in it.”<a name="Anchor-119" id="Anchor-119"></a><a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a> Two
months later he addresses another correspondent
on the same subject. “I am confident,” he says,
giving his view of Scottish opinion at this time,
“if such a thing came to be treated in terms any
ways tolerable, it would find a ready concurrence
of the far greater part of people of all ranks of
this nation.”<a name="Anchor-120" id="Anchor-120"></a><a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> In January 1700, Vernon, writing
to Lord Shrewsbury, says: “My Lord Privy Seal<a name="Anchor-121" id="Anchor-121"></a><a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a>
can no sooner hear the word Union named, but
he runs blindfold into it, and said all he could
think of, for pressing it. My Lord Halifax opposed
it; and said they should run any risk rather than
be bullied by the Scots’ menaces.”<a name="Anchor-122" id="Anchor-122"></a><a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a></p>

<p>The contempt for Scotland which Halifax had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
expressed was common. In another letter Vernon
describes how Sir Edward Seymour, in his place
in Parliament, said that the Union reminded him
of the story about a countryman who was asked
to marry a poor wife, and gave as a reason for
refusing, “that if he married a beggar, he should
have a louse for a portion.” Vernon adds, “this
the Scotch have heard, and are very angry at it.”<a name="Anchor-123" id="Anchor-123"></a><a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a></p>

<p>The king lost no time in declaring his own
opinion. In a speech to the Lords he reminded
them of the Union, which he had recommended
soon after his accession, and again pressed it upon
the consideration of Parliament, as the only means
by which a constant succession of quarrels between
the two countries could be avoided.<a name="Anchor-124" id="Anchor-124"></a><a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> The Lords
at once took his advice, and passed a Bill for
appointing commissioners to treat upon the subject
of the Union, which they sent to the Commons
with the statement that it was a Bill of great
consequence.</p>

<p>At this time there was a great feeling of jealousy
between the two Houses of Parliament, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Commons, resenting the action of the Upper House
in calling special attention to this Bill, seized the
opportunity of picking a quarrel, and appointed a
Committee to report whether there were any precedents
for specially recommending Bills. The
Committee reported that there were several precedents.
Bills had been sent with such recommendations,
both from the Lords to the Commons,
and from the Commons to the Lords. Nevertheless
the Commons rejected the Union Bill upon
the second reading.<a name="Anchor-125" id="Anchor-125"></a><a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a></p>

<p>During the summer of 1700 Scotland was in a
state of dangerous excitement. “The Scotch
look,” Vernon writes, “as if they were ready for
any mischief, and that nothing will please them
but setting up for themselves.” For the last five
years the crops had failed. Thousands had
perished from famine. Thousands more had been
driven to emigrate. The treasury was exhausted.
On the balance of trade there was an annual loss.
The Bank of Scotland, established in 1695, found
that the whole business of the country could be
conducted on a capital of thirty thousand pounds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and so limited was the trade, that neither Glasgow,
Dundee, nor Aberdeen could support a branch of
the bank.<a name="Anchor-126" id="Anchor-126"></a><a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a> So frightful was the state of things
that Fletcher of Saltoun, whose whole mind and
soul were given up to an intense love for Scotland,
thought that no foundation could be laid for better
times except by reducing a great part of the
population to slavery.</p>

<p>The Estates had not met for two years. An
address calling upon the king to assemble a new
Parliament was sent up to London; and it was
openly said, that if he refused, a national convention
would meet, and meet moreover at Perth, where
the members would have “Athol and a part of the
Highlands at their backs.” The staunch Whigs of
the Lowlands laughed in public at the idea of a
rebellion; but they were well aware that society
in Scotland was deeply tainted with that Jacobite
feeling which afterwards gave so much trouble.
It appears, from a letter written by Melville to
Carstares, that attempts had been made to tamper
even with persons who were known and avowed
Whigs. The Duke of Hamilton, “upon his lady’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
birthday,” was entertaining a party of his friends,
among whom were Queensberry, Argyll, and Leven.
After dinner he began to speak in a very confidential
manner to Leven, telling him “that he
loved him,” that he would do all he could to save
him, and that he “would obtain a pardon for him.”
Leven asked him what he meant, saying that he
had done nothing to require a pardon from King
William, and as for King James, he would not
accept one from him. Hamilton saw he had gone
too far, and explained away what he had said.
“It is true,” says Melville, “the duke was very
drunk; but <i>post vinum veritas</i>.”<a name="Anchor-127" id="Anchor-127"></a><a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a></p>

<p>It was plain that the Estates must meet; for
not only was the national outcry too loud to be
ignored, but, the treasury being empty, supplies
must be voted, or the Government could no longer
be carried on. But the misery and discontent was
so universal, that William could not face a general
election. The majority of the old Revolution
Parliament, however, were still sound Whigs; and
it was resolved to summon it once more. The
Government did not rely solely on the help of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
own supporters, but made a carefully-planned
assault on the votes of the Opposition members.
The officers of State themselves undertook the
business. Each agreed to canvass a certain number
of members. Sometimes they set the parish
ministers to work; and in other cases the good
offices of a member’s wife were secured. And
there is no doubt that besides mere solicitation and
appeals to interested motives, there was direct
bribery. The result of these transactions was that
when the Parliament met, in October 1700, the
Government had a majority.<a name="Anchor-128" id="Anchor-128"></a><a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton.</span>
</div>

<p>Queensberry, who was Lord High Commissioner,
had been instructed to ask for supplies for eight
months, but to take less if they were refused. If
the supplies were voted, he was authorised to give
the royal assent to a subsidy in aid of any branch
of Scottish trade which was consistent with the
treaty obligations of the Crown; but if the
Parliament wished to vote money for the African
and Indian Company, it must be applied only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
making good the losses which had been sustained
at Darien. If an Act was passed confirming the
privileges of the Darien colony, the royal assent
was to be at once refused.<a name="Anchor-129" id="Anchor-129"></a><a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a></p>

<p>The Opposition, led by Hamilton, desired to
pass an Act asserting the right of Scotland to the
settlement at Darien, which was the favourite
scheme of the country, and which the Estates had
lately been told from the pulpit was “that great,
laudable, and glorious design and undertaking of
the nation, for the advancement of foreign trade,
which if it be altogether crushed, Scotland is never
like to enjoy such a fair opportunity again, for
promoting her outward wealth and welfare.”<a name="Anchor-130" id="Anchor-130"></a><a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> The
Government, on the other hand, moved an address
to the king praying him to vindicate the honour of
Scotland, and to extend his protection to the
Company.</p>

<p>There was a long and fierce debate. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
those on whom the ministers had relied followed
Hamilton, and others declined to vote. But the
Government had a majority of twenty-four; and
the session ended quietly on the 1st of February
1701.</p>

<p>In Scotland the losses at Darien had brought
to a climax the long-standing feud on the subject
of commerce. The discontent and annoyance
which had been growing ever since the Navigation
Act was passed, had now developed into a most
violent exasperation against England and every
thing that was English. Yet the temperament of
the Scottish people was such that these feelings
did not lead them into plots against the English
Government. They seem to have felt at once that
the greater the obstacles which the jealousy of their
neighbour might put in their way, the greater was
the need for energy and self-help on their own
part. Instead of sinking into apathy and indolence,
or allowing their hatred of England to drive them
into violence, they became more active than ever
in forming plans for bringing solid material
prosperity to their country. The air was full of
projects; and soon these projects took a definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
shape. All Scotland was to became one great
trading company. The subscribers to the African
Company were to be repaid in full. A sum of
money greater than that which had been lost was
to be raised within two years. In spite of English
opposition, colonies were to be founded by
Scotsmen. At home manufactories were to be
established all over the country. The fisheries of
Scotland were to be pursued “to greater profit in
all the markets of Europe than any other fishing
company in Christendom can do.” Employment
was to be found for the poor, “so that in two years
time there shall not be one beggar seen in all the
kingdom.”</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this patriotic ferment
that Hamilton, Tweeddale, Rothes, Roxburghe, and
Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun formed that independent
or national party which, calling itself the
Country Party, was destined, during the next few
years, to pursue a course which ultimately forced
England into uniting with Scotland. This party
had its origin in the assertion of the right of
Scotland to free trade at home and abroad; and
the keynote of its policy was that Scotland should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
refuse to settle the succession to the Scottish
Crown until her grievances were redressed. But
with the death of William and the accession of
Anne, Scottish politics entered upon a new phase;
and here the early history of the Union question
naturally ends.</p>

<span class="smcap">Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun.</span>
</div>

<p>In the first year of Queen Anne, commissioners
were appointed to treat for an Union. They met
at Westminster in October 1702, and agreed that
the two countries should become one monarchy,
with one Parliament, and a system of internal free
trade. The English consented, though reluctantly,
to allow the Scots to trade with the colonies; but
on the subject of the Company of Scotland Trading
to Africa and the Indies no agreement was found
to be possible. The English commissioners maintained
that the privileges of the Scottish Company
interfered with the interests of the East India
Company: “Two companies existing together in
the same kingdom, and carrying on the same
traffic, are destructive to trade.” To this the
Scottish commissioners replied by a claim for
compensation, if the Scottish Company, whose
losses in the Darien expedition had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
disastrous, was abolished. “If,” they said, “the
existing of companies for carrying on the same
traffic, do appear to your Lordships destructive of
trade; it is not expected that your Lordships will
insist, that, therefore, the privileges of the <i>Scots</i>
Company should be abandoned, without offering
at the same time to purchase their right at the
public expense.” This brought matters to a
deadlock; the commissioners separated; and the
negotiations were ultimately abandoned.</p>

<p>Defoe describes these proceedings as a “Sham
Treaty,” and, in his opinion, religion was the real,
though secret, difficulty. “The jealousies,” he
says, “on both sides about Church affairs, in
respect to the Union, were ground of such
difficulties as no Body could surmount, and lay
as a Secret Mine, with which that Party who
designed to keep the nation divided, were sure to
blow it up at last, and therefore knew that all they
did till that Point was discust signified nothing,
and that whenever they pleased to put an end to
it, they had an immediate opportunity.”</p>

<p>But even if the commissioners had come to terms
on the questions of the Scottish Trading Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and of the Church, there can be no doubt that the
Scottish Estates would not have ratified the
treaty; for, as the proceedings of the first
Parliament of Queen Anne proved, Scotland was
now so exasperated against England that nearly
five years of turmoil and danger were to pass
away before the statesmen of the two countries,
brought face to face with something more than
the possibility of civil war, at last succeeded in
carrying the Union of 1707, in the terms of which,
apart from the loss of the right of complete self-government
through their own Parliament, the
advantages lay, upon the whole, with the Scottish
people.</p>

569). Maitland of Lethington, in the letter in favour of an alliance
between England and Scotland, from which quotations have just
been given, proposes that Scotland should help to maintain order in
Ireland. “The realme of Ireland,” he says, “being of natour a

“the manner how the Scottis be divided, 1560,” was recently
found among the MSS. at Longleat, and is now printed in the

<i>History of Scotland</i>, vol. ix. p. 425, a paper is printed entitled
“The Present State of the Nobility in Scotland, 1st July 1592.”
It gives a list of the Scottish peers with a note of whether they
were Protestant or Catholic, and is well worth comparing with the
list in the <i>Hamilton Papers</i>. In the original, Mr. Tytler says, the
names of the Catholics are marked in Burleigh’s own handwriting.</div>

marriage. Darnley, as grandson of Margaret Tudor, was not only
cousin to the Queen of Scots, but first prince of the blood in
England; and Mary’s great object in espousing him was to improve
her chance of succeeding to the Crown of England, to which she
was already heir-presumptive. But in Scotland the marriage of
the queen to a Catholic could not be viewed with indifference;
and the General Assembly of the Church proceeded to declare that
the laws against papacy applied to the royal family as well as to the
subjects: “That the Papisticall and blasphemous masse, with all
Papistrie and idolatrie of Paip’s jurisdictione, be universallie
suppressed and abolished throughout the haill realme, not only in
the subjects, but also in the Q. Majestie’s awn persone” (<i>The Booke

<span class="label">[39]</span></a> Mr. Tytler’s view is that one of the chief objects of Elizabeth
and the English ministers in entering into the League was to make
it easier to deal with the Queen of Scots. “Two months before,”
he says, “her indefatigable minister, Walsingham, had detected
that famous conspiracy known by the name of ‘Babington’s Plot,’
in which Mary was implicated, and for which she afterwards
suffered. It had been resolved by Leicester, Burghley, and
Walsingham, and probably by the queen herself, that this should
be the last plot of the Scottish queen and the Roman Catholic
faction; that the time had come when sufferance was criminal and
weak; that the life of the unfortunate, but still active and formidable,
captive was inconsistent with Elizabeth’s safety and the liberty of
the realm. Hence the importance attached to this League, which
bound the two kingdoms together, in a treaty offensive and defensive,
for the protection of the Protestant faith, and separated the young
king from his mother” (<i>History of Scotland</i>, viii. 288).</div>

<span class="label">[56]</span></a> “Amongst these commissioners there grew a question, whether
there could be made an Union of the Kingdoms by raising a new
Kingdome of Great Britaine, before there was an Union of the
Lawes. Which question, by the King’s commandment, was
referred to all the Judges of England in Trinity Terme, Anno
2 Jac., who unanimously resolved (I being then Attorney General
and present), that Anglia had lawes, and Scotia had lawes, but
this new erected Kingdome of Britannia should have no law.
And, therefore, where all the judiciall proceedings in England are
secundum legem et consuetudinem Angliæ, it could not be altered
secundum legem et consuetudinem Britanniæ, untill there was an
Union of the lawes of both Kingdomes; which could not be done
but by Authority of Parliament in either Kingdome” (Coke’s
<i>Institutes</i>, part iv. cap. 75). On one point connected with the legal
system of Scotland, James displayed greater foresight than even the
Whigs of 1707. “The greatest hinderance,” he says in the
<i>Basilikon Doron</i>, “to the execution of our lawes in this countrie,
are these heritable Sheifdomes and Regalities, which being in the
hands of the great men, doe wracke the whole countrey.” And
then he recommends his son to look forward to a time when he
might be able to abolish them, and introduce the English system;
“Preassing with time, to draw it to the lawdable custome of
England; which ye may the easilier doe, being King of both, as I
hope in God ye shall.” The Heritable Jurisdictions, a curse to Scotland,
were not abolished until after the second Jacobite Rebellion.</div>

Ascension, contains these remarkable words: “The remembrance
of quhilk day, and of the Judgement to be executed in the same, is
not onelie to us ane brydle whereby our carnal lustes are refrained,
bot alswa sik inestimable comfort, that nether may the threatning
of wordly Princes, nether zit the feare of temporal death and
present danger, move us to renounce and forsake that blessed
societie, quhilk we the members have with our head and onelie

and offices, gif Man or Angel presume to intrude themself, we
utterlie detest and abhorre them, as blasphemous to our Soveraine
and supreme Governour Christ Jesus.” The twenty-fifth article is
entitled, “Of the Civil Magistrate”; and these two articles, when
read together, contain the germ of the Scottish idea of an Established
Church. This Confession was ratified by the Estates in
1567, Act. Parl. Scot.</div>

(edited from the original MS. by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe,
1817), pp. 64, 65. In Law’s <i>Memorialls</i> (edited from the MS. by
Mr. Sharpe in 1818) there is a passage which, if it is to be relied
on, shows that during this period the course of religion had been
advanced by the policy of preventing the clergy interfering so
constantly in politics. “It is not to be forgotten,” Law says,
“that, from the year 1652 to the year 1660, there was great good
done by the preaching of the gospell in the West of Scotland,
more than was observed to have been for twenty or thirty yeirs
before; a great many being brought in to Christ Jesus by a saving
work of conversion, which was occasioned through ministers preaching
nothing all that tyme but the gospell, and had left off to preach

it.”</div>

<span class="label">[99]</span></a> <i>The grievances of Scotland in relation to their trade with
England, sent up to the Council</i>, 3 Feb. 1668. See also a paper
given in by the Scots Commissioners for adjusting the differences of
trade between the two kingdoms, Jan. 21, 1667 (1668), printed in
Defoe, App. No. xiii., and in the “Report on the events and
circumstances which produced the union of the kingdoms of
England and Scotland” (App. No. xxxi.). This report, which was
prepared for the private use of the Government, at the request of
the Duke of Portland, in 1799, when the Union with Ireland was
being discussed, contains most of the papers which passed between
the Commissioners on Trade in 1668. The <i>Calendar of State Papers,
Domestic</i>, 1667-1668, published in 1893, throws some light on
these transactions. It appears that the coal merchants of Newcastle
and the North of England had a grievance in the inequality
of the export duties levied on coal in the two countries. English
coal paid eight shillings, and Scottish coal only twenty pence.
The result was said to be that the customs from coal had fallen in
that part of the country, from £20,000 a year to £4000, and that
English merchants were suffering from the importation into
Scotland, in exchange for coal, of foreign goods which the Scots
used to obtain from England. (Memorial of 24th Feb. 1668.
<i>Calendar</i>, p. 247.)</div>

<span class="label">[100]</span></a> Burnet, i. 513. Lord Dartmouth, in a note on this passage,
states that William the Third told Lord Jersey that it was a
standing maxim in the Stuart family, “Whatever advances they
pretended to make towards it,” never to allow a union. Their
reason, he said, was that it could not take place without admitting
Scotsmen to both Houses of Parliament, who must depend for a
living on the Crown. He further asserts that King William said
he hoped it would never take place during his reign, for “he had
not the good fortune to know what would satisfy a Scotsman.”</div>

the Scottish peers, and some members of the Scottish Whig party,
had held a private conference and agreed that the Jacobite clergy
should be unmolested. The English bishops represented the case of
the Scottish Episcopal clergy to William about the same time. But
it was doubtless felt that any attempt to pass an Act of Toleration
through the Scottish Parliament would fail. (Rawlinson MSS.
